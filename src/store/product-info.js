				"I got my new MacBook Pro M1 two weeks ago and could not be more happy with it. This machine is absolutely incredible in terms of speed, looks, weight/size, display, and battery life - and texture (it feels so good against the skin on my wrists as I type) and basically anything else you can think of. I also love the space gray color, the new keyboard, the Touch Bar, and the larger trackpad. There are so many options to customize the system to work just the way I like.\nMy previous MacBook was the 2011 model and it still works today, but after 10 years it became too slow and the trackpad had trouble clicking, so after a TON of research, I decided to pull the trigger and get the New MacBook Pro with the M1 chip.\nA couple suggestions I am able to give after spending almost two months and probably over 30 hours researching the new MacBook are: go with the standard model of 8gb of RAM and the 256 ssd - you can get this on Amazon for $1239 vs $1299 at Apple - so you get to save 60 bucks, and you have the added satisfaction of not having to deal with the snobby nerd losers that work in the Apple Store, who asked me rudely when I went in to get a new laptop \"umm, do you have an appointment? Well, you're going to have to make an appointment if you want to go in the store\". I love Apple products and will never use another phone or computer besides the iPhone and MacBook, but after that experience I will never again give my business to the physical Apple Stores. I mean, seriously, do you really need me to make an appointment to buy a $1300 laptop? Whatever dude.\nAnyway, in several YouTube videos that compared the 8GB ram model along side the 16GB ram model (costs 200 bucks more), the 8GB performed just as well in nearly every task - and they really pushed it to the limits. The only reason to pay up for the 16GB RAM is if you want to edit 8K UHD videos or are a super serious music recording artist or highly advanced professional photographer - and even then it's not too much of a difference. For the every day user (me or basically anyone who is not a computer professional) the 8GB working with this new M1 chip is mind-blowing, blows any other laptop on the market completely out of the water, and actually even performs just as well as the $2200 15 inch MacBook Pro using the Intel chip. As far as the storage goes, 256 ssd is standard - that's what I got - and you can pay 200 bucks more for 512 ssd or 400 bucks more for 1 TB. But with the Cloud storage available now, you don't really need to keep much on the laptop drive, you can just save it to the cloud.\nOverall I honestly could go on for hours about every little detail that I absolutely love about this machine. A free one year subscription to Apple TV is also another little perk. But I am still mystified every day at how incredible this machine is. I've been online for over 3 hours now and its still on 92% battery. The new Retina display is brilliant. Everything is perfect. I truly am in love this laptop and would recommend that anyone looking for a new laptop to last a long time and outperform everything else on the market gets the new matchbook 13 inch M1.",

				"I primarily use my MacBook Pro for music production and performance. As such, Logic Pro and myriad amp models/plugins are constantly in use on my machine. The M1 chip blows the Intel chips out of the water in terms of loading speed, battery life, and ability to handle large Logic projects with dozens of tracks, plugins, software instruments, and live recordings.\nattery life has also seen a significant improvement over my 2020 Intel machine. I am not quite getting double the battery life, but it's not far off. This isn't a huge deal for me, as my machine is typically stationary and a charging cable is readily available, but for someone who needs the portability, the difference is substantial.\nUPDATE 6/16/21: I have been using this laptop for over 6 months now on a daily basis. I have done everything from Word documents, email, web surfing, Logic Pro, Neural DSP guitar plugins, Adobe Lightroom, Adobe Illustrator, and many other tasks and I do not think that I have even heard the fan come on 1 time. It's pretty astounding. The M1 is still exceedingly snappy and the battery life blows me away. And while more and more apps become native to M1, I'd expect performance to do nothing but improve.",

				"Everyone says the new Apple Macbook with an M-1 chip is wonderful. However, I would say something different.\nFor the Macbook pro with an M1 chip, I spent almost twice the price but got the same performance as MacBook air. The only 2 differences are the fan and the touch bar(it's useless).\nSecondly, would be quality. Once a time I put on the interface, the MacBook turns off itself. I don't know what happened but I'm pretty sure this kind of problem should not happen in a computer at such a price.nAlso, I miss the MagSafe... ",

If you have software on CD/DVD, be aware that your bus powered DVD drive probably will not work. Same if you attach external storage that needs more power than a newer SSD. To fix this you need a hub / dock that is externally powered and supplies power to any device plugged into the hub.",

				"I love my MacBook Pro! I had the 13 inch macbook air 2017 and I hated that thing, used it for college and i wanted to get rid of it so bad so i gave it away. I always wanted the macbook pro because i thought they were just built better and i the interface of how its designed looked way better. Finally was able to buy one and so far so good. I really hope and pray this one doesn't start going slow like how my macbook air did after a year or 2. Bought one for my friend as well and she loves hers. I mainly use it for work, school/zoom calls and a little bit of streaming. Not a gamer so battery life is something i never have to worry about. Battery life was amazing for the first 2 weeks but I can tell now the battery has been dying slightly faster but i believe it's from how much i've been on it lately but if i put it down for a few days (most likely 2) battery life hangs in there.",

				"I FINALLY, after years of my artist friends and colleagues using apple product (laptops, MacBooks, desktops) I decided I’d get one as I needed a new laptop since my previous one was 10 years old. At first, I was just sad for having spent so much. I thought “this better convince me otherwise”. After having this for two months, I can say I hate it.\nDon’t get me wrong, there’s some decent features that add convenience, but I struggle to complete work in a timely manner as I have to constantly save or redo lost work. The MacBook can’t consistently run (for example) Adobe InDesign, Adobe Illustrator, and one Google page. I know you’re probably thinking “maybe her file size of the projects she’s working on are bogging down a successful running speed and responsiveness.” That is not the case.\nThe work I am creating at this moment in time is basic web design, typographic studies of minor levels of file work, and an occasional image that needs photoshopped.\nAll in all, this product is a bit expensive for my liking. It’s got many decent aspects, such as a finger ID to unlock easily and touchscreen bar along the top of the keyboard display. Cool. But not worth $1,300 (after tax) if it is going to prohibit my work in graphic design.",

				"These may not be the best performance noise cancelling headphones, but they are outstanding value. I bought them for my daughter first, and my wife and I kept stealing them when she fell asleep on the plane. They are helpful even if you're not listening to anything - just to diminish the airplane roar on long flights. Next I bought myself a pair and my wife was stealing mine. I even started using them at home when I was working on the computer and wife/kid were watching TV. Then I got some for my wife, and finally my mother. Now nobody steals each other's headphones. My mother really appreciated hers on a long Norway flight. Imagine the cost of all these headphones if we were buying the $200+ a pair headphones... You can wear these for several hours without getting uncomfortable, they make the quietest movie easily hear-able, and they diminish the airplane roar by about 50%, which is a huge benefit. I have worn them, and the Bose do perform noticeably better, but it's not worth the money if you have to buy them for a whole family.",

				"If you're looking for an inexpensive noise reducing (note, I did not say cancelling) headset for use on an airplane, the Sony MDRX110NC is a really solid buy. If you are looking for a headset that truly cancels all noise, you are going to be disappointed with this purchase.\nPros:\n-They work well at reducing airplane engine noise (the reason I bought them.)\n-Compact due to their folding design.\n-On ear design, which work very well if you wear glasses.\n-Price, price, price.\nCons:\n-Do not have the best sound, so if you're looking for Bose like quality, stop here.\n-I found the cord length a tad short, but certainly wasn't a deal breaker.\nIn order for these to do their job, you simply must turn the switch on, without them they are no better (perhaps even worse) than the free earbuds that come with any smartphone. Both my wife and I have used the one set we own on business trips. Having just booked a trip to Europe, I just bought a second set so that we will both have them for the long flight.\nFor the price, these headphones are good enough, and if anything were to happen to them, I would't feel nearly as bad as I would if I had paid $300-400 for top of the line headphones.",

				"Now that we have had these for a few months and tried them on an airplane as well as at home, I can report that for the price, these are very effective noise cancelling headphones. They do not eliminate all airplane noise, but I was able to watch a movie at half volume, whereas when I use earbuds, I have to crank it up to 100%. In addition, I have started using them when I do digital recording so that I can hear any background noises that are coming through the recording device without them being masked by ambient noise reaching my ears through the muffs. This helped me on a video project without having to spend 100s of dollars for something I will use in that way only 2-3 times a year. I assume they will also be useful in setting up sound systems in our community theatre and will try them out for the next play. Warning: Don't leave the battery in the unit when it is dormant. One reason is to avoid the possibility of battery leakage, but the most important reason is that it is easy to forget to turn them off, and the battery will then drain while just sitting there.",

				"I bought these thiking that I'd be able to wear them and not be able to heard the background noise of my girlfriend watching the tv. Whilst they do allow me to concentrate on studying and reduce noise, I can still hear the tv in the background, and I have to actively be listening to something in order for them to work at all - I can't just cancel out the background noise without foreground noise. Also, the small size of the headphones means that they don't fit over the whole ear, so after more than about an hour of wearing them they start to get uncomfortable from pressing against my ears.\nHaving said this, the sound quality is pretty good, and the difference between the active mode and passive mode is really noticeable - as soon as I turn them to active the bass response improves and it's as if I can hear all the fine details that I couldn't hear in passive mode. They're pretty good value for money too, and they feel quite well made.",

				'Because of the nice reviews, I had high expectations with this product.\nBut it rapidly appeared to be very, very bad.\nWhen I received them, I first tried them at home and the noise cancellation would not cover the family or kids voices/noises. Disappointing.\nLater, I went to the local mall and definitely the noise cancellation does not cover any of the background noises, such as music, conversations, steps, etc. There is no perceptible difference between the noise cancellation "on" and "off" position (yes, I correctly inserted the battery and checked that the light would turn on, as per the instructions manual).\nOutside, they appeared to over amplify the wind noise, and that was really annoying! It was way better with noise cancellation turned off than on, which is a shame.\nEven if they look OK, they are made of creaking and cheap plastic, but for the price paid, I cannot complain.\nI didn\'t have the time to try them in an airplane, because I immediately returned them to Amazon.\nI would suggest avoiding these earphones.',

				"UPDATE 12-15-2020 - After three weeks, I'm still really impressed with the M1 MacBook Air/8 Core CPU/8 Core GPU/512 SSD/8GB RAM. --- My updated plea: MAKE SURE YOU GET AS MUCH MEMORY & STORAGE AS YOU CAN AFFORD. SPECIAL ORDER ONE TO YOUR PROJECTED FUTURE NEED!\nRemember, Macs live a very long time and the value it holds will depend on how usable it will be to you or someone else in 5 or even 10 years. Not that long ago, 80 GB hard drives were HUGE... and UPGRADABLE. RAM was upgradable. The SSD and the RAM in these machines is NOT upgradable.\nThe one issue for me has been that I am a memory hog! I tend to have LOTS of tabs open at once (I've caught myself with 50 (Safari) open in one browser and 39 (Chrome) in another!), while running Affinity/Final Cut Pro - and YES, the dreaded Beach Ball has reared it's ugly head. Well, this got me to assess what I will be using the machine for and for how long.\nStorage can be added with external drives, slower, but it will let you scrape by. RAM is another story. When you constantly use up RAM, the system starts using \"swap memory\" where it uses the SSD to store temporary files. One of the YouTube reviewers (Created Labs) explains it like this: RAM memory is like writing on a white board, it's made to be temporary. Writing to the SSD is like writing on paper with a pencil. It can be erased, but if it's written on and erased for too long, it's going to degrade the medium. It will take years for this to cause problems, but keep in mind that in these M1 MacBooks, none of the parts are replaceable. The SSD and the RAM are soldered onto the board.\n***As ridiculously expensive as Apple RAM is, when it's not upgradable, get the maximum, in this case, 16 GB.\nI really doubt that Apple will be making machines with user upgradable RAM after the switch from Intel is complete, except for possibly the very high end Pro models.\nThere is also the fact that if I am going to be doing a decent amount of video editing, a M1 with a fan will be helpful. Upgrading to the cheaper ($699+Upgrades) M1 Mac mini would be the cheapest way to get better performance for the Pro Apps, but I need a laptop, so... So, that is why I'm planning to return this machine and get one (likely the MacBook Pro M1), with 16 GB RAM & 1 TB SSD.\n***A note on browsers, Safari is by far the BEST browser to run on the M1, at least for now. I always had issues with saving web pages as PDF files in Chrome, where it did not save most of the images/text on the page. In Safari, it's worked perfectly.\n------\nI purchased the MacBook Air M1, 8 core GPU, and 8 core CPU model, with 512 GB SSD and 8 GB RAM in person at the Apple Store (11-20-2020), with education pricing. I traded in my (MNYH2LL/A) - 2017 12\" Macbook with the Intel M3 processor, 256 GB SSD, 8 GB Ram. I kept my charging adapter & C-cable (which are both compatible with the M1 Late 2020 Macbook Air), so ended up with a $330 Apple Store instant credit towards the M1.\nThe M1 model has blown me away with its speed and smooth running with a large number of apps open, including Final Cut & Logic Pro. Admittedly the 2017 MB was the bottom of the line and I suffered under frequent overheating issues with too many things open and the single C-port fiasco.\nI likely would have gone with the 7 core GPU model if one had been in stock at the time of purchase, but I wanted 512 GB of SSD space, so I paid more by going with eh 8 core. From everything that I've seen, the lack of more RAM upgrades is not nearly as important as it was with the Intel x86 processors and is really only useful when you have many GPU intensive \"Pro Apps\" running at the same time.\nI would never have dreamed of running Final Cut or Logic Pro on the 2017 Macbook, so this has been an amazing upgrade for me.\nI would say that the bottom line is that if you're someone who only uses a laptop for office & basic web surfing and only has a few tabs open at once, and you never experience overheating or the dreaded beach ball \"not responding\" issues, or if you have non-Apple programs that have not been compiled for the M1 chip, hold off on the upgrade until more apps run natively on the M1. If however, you really need a machine that is MUCH more capable, faster and cooler running than the Intel models, it's a solid buy and an amazing upgrade from any non-upgradable Mac.",

It gets crashes and will freeze the computer. Everything else runs super smoothly and I never have issues. Really happy with the laptop.\nInitial post:\nLet me start this off by saying I was very skeptical. Lifelong Windows user, I've only had an iPod touch (2011) and very briefly an iPhone 6 (I think). I also have pretty demanding needs as far as day to day laptop use goes.\nThis thing has handled everything I've thrown at it so far. The only drawback is that my current model only has 8GB RAM, but if you're conscious about what you have open it's not an issue; even with more intensive programs like Photoshop or Unreal Engine 4. Neither of which are even optimized for the platform yet, which as stated in the title, is really impressive.\nGaming has been equally impressive. To be fair, I haven't thrown a next-gen game at it yet, but I threw games that I thought would be able to max it out. Nope, Civ 6, Borderlands 1, and Oxygen Not Included all ran at Ultra with FPS staying at steady 60+ in each game, even in more intensive portions of each game. I'm not saying it'll be able to play every game at ultra, but it's definitely been able to handle more than I though it would. It almost seems to be outperforming my desktop, which has an i7@3.4, and a 970ti. I think it might if I had the extra GPU core and 16gb ram, which is crazy for a laptop at this price.\nOverall, it's worth every penny. I could rant about all the small features that make the OS amazing as well, but you can find videos of that online/may already be familiar.",

				"Lightweight, blazing fast, easy to use, battery life is incredible with the new Apple M1 chip. A typical Great Apple product.\nHowever, there is only a Thunderbolt port, so you now have to go out and buy a cable to convert USB to thunderbolt (if you want to use a backup hard drive) or other USB items, AND, I had to buy yet another cable to sync my phone's lightning port to the thunderbolt port on the computer. Total $56.\nI LOVE Apple product, and worked for them in my caerer, but I would wait on buying this version until the software for it has been developed.\nUPDATE: After several months of using this computer, I have have found several things of concern:\n1. my notification center keeps disappearing, despite my constant reinstalling the widgets.\n2. my computer's calendar, reminders, and photo stream do not sync with my IOS devices (iPhone & iPad).\nIf I add an item to calendar on my phone, it will appear on my mac but not vice versa.\nReminders will not sync regardless of which device I originate the item on.\nI have contacted Apple support on all these issues and they cannot solve the problem.\nIT APPEARS THAT THE BUGS HAVE NOT BEEN WORKED OUT, YET.

				"If you've been waiting for Apple to wake up and address the concerns raised by the Apple community -- your wait is now over. This is the MacBook Pro we've all been wanting for years. This review is for the higher end model, stock.\nThe good.\n- Keyboard. It's fantastic. The key travel has been extended to 1mm, which is about half of the original keyboard found on the 2015 and prior model years. It feels just as good to type on because apple improved the tactile feedback. The keys sort of spring back. The keyboard is quiet and very comfortable to type on. The keys are slightly smaller but do not make typing on them any more difficult. The directional arrows are now properly setup and the physical Esc key is back, making it a breeze to flip through open applications.\n- Screen. The difference in size is subtle but noticeable. It's technically even more dense, but just barely. You won't notice much difference from recent MacBook Pros but true to Apple, the display is absolutely gorgeous. The 0.6 inch difference in size retains the same logical resolution, so everything should look just slightly bigger which I welcome.\n- Processor. The base model has the same chipset as the 2019 15.4\" model. The performance, however, is about 10% better due to significantly improved airflow and larger heatsinks. The issue of heat related throttling has been largely addressed. On the upper model, the machine now comes with 8 cores and serious performance bump. There is literally nothing you can throw at this MacBook that it won't handle with breeze.\n- Graphics. The traditional setup is still here. You have the onboard Intel chipset, which operates when the demand for visual performance is low. You also have a discrete AMD chip which delivers significant improvement over the previous generation. In fact, the base model delivers performance in excess of the upper spec Vega chipset from last year. The leap is extraordinary. As before, the system will automatically choose which graphics card to use depending on demand.\n- Sound. In one world, amazing. Imagine Apple took a HomePod and flattened it to fit it in the housing of the MacBook Pro. That is essentially the experience. Bass is pronounced and crisp and treble is sharp. The sound is rich and room-filling. There are six speakers instead of two in the last generation.\n-Microphone. Major improvements with three mics instead of one in the previous generation. I use the MacBook to make calls using an iPhone and the sound on the other end is clear and free from background noice. I've been told it sounds a lot better than before, but that is of course subjective. On paper, you're getting better noise reduction and improved sound fidelity.\n- Touch Bar. Controversial in the past, I think it may now be the \"happy medium\" between physical keys and the useful Touch Bar which adapts to the content on the screen. The Esc key is back and on the right hand side you'll find Touch ID and power button.\n- SSD. You'll love the fact that now base starting size of the SSD has been doubled on both the entry model and the upper model with 512GB and 1TB respectively.\n- Gaming. This has to be mentioned. The graphics card offers incredible leap in performance. Modern games that would get 14-16FPS on high setting now perform at 35-40FPS with ease. Same settings. Same games. Huge improvement. It's now possible to play AAA games on the MacBook Pro with reasonable performance and high visual settings.\n- Productivity. This machine is a beast. I use the full Affinity suite and do some limited video editing. In addition, I have multiple productivity programs open, over a dozen Safari tabs, two email clients, and dozens of other apps, such as CRM, task managers, notes, etc. Everything runs smoothly.\n- Value. Yes, value. This expensive laptop brings the best value in the lineup of the 15.\"4 (now 16\") offering to date. If you carefully look at the costs of truly compatible Windows offerings, you'll find the MacBook Pro to be competitively priced.\nThe Bad\n- Weight. The machine is slightly heavier but I welcome the added bulky. Finally Apple went with functionality over its obsession with thiner and lighter hardware, giving us a machine with proper thermal management, proper keyboard and more. But if you plan on taking it with you places, you'll feel the extra bulk.\n- BTO Updates. The cost of BTO options is still quite high, with the noted exception of the 8GB option on the GPU. You're still paying a significant premium for each incremental upgrade over the base model.\nTo sum up -- This is the best MacBook Pro in many years. It's a well-rounded, powerful machine that brings about incredible performance and value. I would highly recommend it to any Pro.\nIf you're upgrading from the 13\" model and wonder how much more real estate you can expect, see attached side-by-side comparison photo.\nUpdate 3/15/20 -- Absolutely a beast of a machine. I love it. It has been pretty much perfect and its performance continues to surprise me. I have the top-speced model and it smokes pretty much everything I've used to date. In fact, it will perform on par with the new Mac Pro base configuration. Don't believe me? Google it. This is by far the best MacBook Pro to date and an amazing value. Well worth the price of admission if you need it.",

				"The performance differences between it and it's predecessor are marginal, at best ...\nYet you are being asked to pay $2400 for membership. Think back to around 2015, when the previous gen entry cost was still $ 2000, then they changed it to $2400. For that, you got shafted with a crap keyboard, a failing display, an identity crisis for a touch-bar, and less connectivity.\nNow that this latest model came out and people are buying it, they are bolstering Apple's position: never apologize for hardware issues, make ppl pay extra for AppleCare+, give folks a real working keyboard and make it look like they are doing you a favor so the prices are .... what .... justified ?\nApple's pricing schemes make you wonder if they think they can get ppl to believe that hardware is actually comparable to a commodity, or something like that.\nLastly, you do not know what kind of quality issues lurk behind these new models ....",

				"Edit: The prices change quite a bit, and Amazon doesn't do price-matching, so keep an eye out for that. There's a website that shows the lowest price for each configuration, so check that out first before buying. I ended up returning my i7 MBP to get the i9 because 512GB of space just isn't that much, and definitely wasn't enough for my purposes. Both are excellent machines and I'm waiting to see how hot the i9 gets under sustained load.\n\nI used to have a lot of apple products, with my last macbook being the 2012 13 and 15\" macbook pros. I ended up giving those to friends as I transitioned to a new windows-based laptop for college.\n\n7 years later, and I finally had a compelling reason to purchase the newest MBP: a normal keyboard, USB C, larger screen, and improved thermals. My main gripe with thin and light laptops like the Dell XPS 13 and Thinkpad X1 Carbon (6th gen) has been that their thermals are awful. My hands would burn up while typing, even after a good repaste and undervolt. It also didn't help that their screens were on the smaller side.\n\nI've had the new MBP for a few days now. I bought the base model i7, and while I'm enjoying it, I do wish I sprung for the i9 at the very least due to the 1TB of storage. I have handfuls of external storage, but it really gets annoying to have to go through different drives when storage fills up. I do use more storage than a typical user IMO, as I typically have Bootcamp installed along with different CAD programs, IDEs, datasets, etc. However, I'm sure the extra storage would be nice for anyone.\n\nSo far, the transition has been great! My only issue so far has been the battery life - 10 to 11 hours is definitely a stretch, and I personally found myself running out of battery after 4-5 hours of heavy multi-tasking, fans at a constant 60% (basically inaudible in a packed starbucks), at full brightness, with a lot of external power-hungry peripherals. Honestly, that's not that bad!",

				"I finally traded in my 15\" 2015 MBP for the 16\" MBP.\nThe old one has a better keyboard, but the 16\" is passable (unlike the ones between). The 16\" is actually smaller than the 15\" I had, so, if anything, it's more transportable.\nFor what I do, writing, the processor speed doesn't speed up the creative process. But I figure amortizing the cost over 5 years makes it a pretty good investment.\nScreen resolution, for my purposes, is no different. Processor speed is for gamers, but I find launching apps from the Dock is frustratingly slow. This is a Finder issue, as apps launch but don't leap to the top. Why not?\nThe most useful improvement for me is the log-in via fingerprint. Much faster than typing in a password. And I have to say the response is instant.\nI do not find the touch bar useful, because I touch type. I rarely look at the keyboard, so I don't see what it offers. Hunt and peck types may find it more useful.\nThe lousy camera doesn't bother me, because I don't use it. But, if I did, I would be miffed Apple is unloading their inventory of 720p cameras in a high priced machine.\nThe speakers are simply amazing. I've never heard such sound quality out of a laptop. You just have to hear it to believe. Subwoofers in a laptop? Amazing.\nIn short, I am very pleased with my new 16\" MBP. A couple of things are annoying, but there are several additions that reassure me that there has been some improvement over that past 5 years.",

Because the Pixel's battery was old Google stopped supporting security updates, I decided to upgrade. I thought about a Pixel 4a, but when I saw this phone in online comparisons and its 120hz screen, huge battery, and top-of-the-line processor for $600, that seemed like too good of a deal. While the OS is gussied up a bit from what's in the Pixel line, it's not hard to figure out the differences and it adds a slight premium feel.The only negatives in comparison to the Pixel are the camera software isn't as good, and the price is greater: $250 more than the 4a and $100 more than the 4a 5G. I had to look hard at my criteria to justify the extra cost, but I feel that the Pixel software doesn't add enough to the photos and that the extra cost gave me a phone with the kinds of features that will tide me over an additional year that the Pixel phones--with their weaker processors--likely would not. If anything else, it should have decent trade-in value in a year or two.",

				"I decided on the Samsung Galaxy S20 FE for my smartphone upgrade for a lot of reasons. One, and most obviously, was the price. At $599 ( the price on Amazon when I purchased it), it was an unbeatable deal. Another was the specs: Snapdragon 865 and 6gb of RAM was perfect for my needs. My old Galaxy S7 looked practically primitive when set against the S20 FE. And so, I decided to give a midrange phone a try.At first glance, the S20 FE seemed too good to be true. The screen, while not 4K, still looks great with the 120Hz refresh rate enabled. The rear cameras look incredibly good, nice and crisp. I've done everything from web browsing and gaming to word processing and photography, all with minimal issue. Battery life is solid, but not the best in the market right now. You'll still be able to get a couple of days out of the S20 FE on 120Hz. Also, you can't beat the customizability of Android. With the option to install launchers/widgets plus a wealth of storage (and SD card support), you get a lot of choice with the S20 FE. The size, while much larger than I was used to, still fits in the hand really well. I would recommend getting a case and screen protector for this one though, as I have seen people shatter the screen with a single drop.But, if you've been reading up on the S20 FE at all, then you know that there are problems. First off, the virtual proximity sensor on the phone is spotty at best. Testing it out myself, I had to be right on top of the sensor for it to detect my face. And for phone calls, that means a few more accidental muted/ended calls than usual. The face recognition and fingerprint scanner are also not great. I'd say it works about 85% of the time, but when it doesn't, do you ever feel it. Adding on, the front-facing camera is pretty lackluster. Not bad, but it's not flagship levels by any stretch. You'll need to be in absolutely optimal lighting to get a decent picture out of it. So if you're looking for a phone to take selfies indoors with, I'd look elsewhere.From what I've seen, the standout complaint with the S20 FE is the touchscreen. And yes, my phone (ordered in early November) has the issue too. Pretty horrendous ghosting when testing it in the touchscreen test app. There's undeniably a hardware issue with the S20 FE. There have been updates since the phone released, but none have fixed it entirely; merely a band-aid on a bloody gash. The real question is: does it affect everyday use? Will you notice it every moment you use the S20 FE? The answer to both is no, at least for me. While I'm sure it does affect certain tasks (most notably those that involve fast touches or 3+ fingers), I really haven't noticed it in actual use. Pinching/zooming with your fingers close together will cause the screen to jitter, but that's about all I've seen. If that worries you enough to pass on the S20 FE, I don't blame you.It really is a shame that I can't give the S20 FE a perfect 5 stars, because it does deserve it in some aspects. But with these hardware issues, there's always the worry that time will make them worse. It's a genuine worry, I get that. But even with the problems, the Samsung Galaxy S20 FE is a pretty great phone. It really does feel like a flagship phone, but with a massive price cut and a few downgrades. Only time will tell if the problems the phone has will get worse, but for right now, I'm more than happy with it.",

				" This was the perfect phone until I started wondering what was wrong with my screen. Your touchs will be misread causing random inputs and jitter. This is a recording of how the phone is recognizing my inputs when using two fingers in alternating succession as well as when swiping with two fingers. This effects everyday use in subtle but frustrating ways. From taps being read as scrolling to unplayable multitouch games, the screen makes me miss my 3 year old galaxy S8. The most recent software update to fix the issue has made no difference. If you buy this phone it WILL have this problem. I was originally in the group that assumed mine wasn't affected, but it became hard to ignore the signs after a week.",

That makes me feel lured into something I wasn't expecting.The phone is a solid overall phone with premium performance for the price due to sacrificing the build quality by making the back plastic and the screen gorilla glass 3 instead of 6.Doesn't matter to me as I wanted an unused device (battery) with a top notch processor for the smallest price point.I'm still slightly upset about not getting 8gb as was listed when I purchased which is why I didn't rate 5/5.",

				"Just got this yesterday, the day it came out. I got the Navy Blue, which looks great. I got it to replace my 1st generation Pixel XL. Because the Pixel's battery was old Google stopped supporting security updates, I decided to upgrade. I thought about a Pixel 4a, but when I saw this phone in online comparisons and its 120hz screen, huge battery, and top-of-the-line processor for $600, that seemed like too good of a deal. While the OS is gussied up a bit from what's in the Pixel line, it's not hard to figure out the differences and it adds a slight premium feel.The only negatives in comparison to the Pixel are the camera software isn't as good, and the price is greater: $250 more than the 4a and $100 more than the 4a 5G. I had to look hard at my criteria to justify the extra cost, but I feel that the Pixel software doesn't add enough to the photos and that the extra cost gave me a phone with the kinds of features that will tide me over an additional year that the Pixel phones--with their weaker processors--likely would not. If anything else, it should have decent trade-in value in a year or two.",

				"I decided on the Samsung Galaxy S20 FE for my smartphone upgrade for a lot of reasons. One, and most obviously, was the price. At $599 ( the price on Amazon when I purchased it), it was an unbeatable deal. Another was the specs: Snapdragon 865 and 6gb of RAM was perfect for my needs. My old Galaxy S7 looked practically primitive when set against the S20 FE. And so, I decided to give a midrange phone a try.At first glance, the S20 FE seemed too good to be true. The screen, while not 4K, still looks great with the 120Hz refresh rate enabled. The rear cameras look incredibly good, nice and crisp. I've done everything from web browsing and gaming to word processing and photography, all with minimal issue. Battery life is solid, but not the best in the market right now. You'll still be able to get a couple of days out of the S20 FE on 120Hz. Also, you can't beat the customizability of Android. With the option to install launchers/widgets plus a wealth of storage (and SD card support), you get a lot of choice with the S20 FE. The size, while much larger than I was used to, still fits in the hand really well. I would recommend getting a case and screen protector for this one though, as I have seen people shatter the screen with a single drop.But, if you've been reading up on the S20 FE at all, then you know that there are problems. First off, the virtual proximity sensor on the phone is spotty at best. Testing it out myself, I had to be right on top of the sensor for it to detect my face. And for phone calls, that means a few more accidental muted/ended calls than usual. The face recognition and fingerprint scanner are also not great. I'd say it works about 85% of the time, but when it doesn't, do you ever feel it. Adding on, the front-facing camera is pretty lackluster. Not bad, but it's not flagship levels by any stretch. You'll need to be in absolutely optimal lighting to get a decent picture out of it. So if you're looking for a phone to take selfies indoors with, I'd look elsewhere.From what I've seen, the standout complaint with the S20 FE is the touchscreen. And yes, my phone (ordered in early November) has the issue too. Pretty horrendous ghosting when testing it in the touchscreen test app. There's undeniably a hardware issue with the S20 FE. There have been updates since the phone released, but none have fixed it entirely; merely a band-aid on a bloody gash. The real question is: does it affect everyday use? Will you notice it every moment you use the S20 FE? The answer to both is no, at least for me. While I'm sure it does affect certain tasks (most notably those that involve fast touches or 3+ fingers), I really haven't noticed it in actual use. Pinching/zooming with your fingers close together will cause the screen to jitter, but that's about all I've seen. If that worries you enough to pass on the S20 FE, I don't blame you.It really is a shame that I can't give the S20 FE a perfect 5 stars, because it does deserve it in some aspects. But with these hardware issues, there's always the worry that time will make them worse. It's a genuine worry, I get that. But even with the problems, the Samsung Galaxy S20 FE is a pretty great phone. It really does feel like a flagship phone, but with a massive price cut and a few downgrades. Only time will tell if the problems the phone has will get worse, but for right now, I'm more than happy with it.",

				" This was the perfect phone until I started wondering what was wrong with my screen. Your touchs will be misread causing random inputs and jitter. This is a recording of how the phone is recognizing my inputs when using two fingers in alternating succession as well as when swiping with two fingers. This effects everyday use in subtle but frustrating ways. From taps being read as scrolling to unplayable multitouch games, the screen makes me miss my 3 year old galaxy S8. The most recent software update to fix the issue has made no difference. If you buy this phone it WILL have this problem. I was originally in the group that assumed mine wasn't affected, but it became hard to ignore the signs after a week.",

				"So far the watch is everything I’d hoped it would be! I’ve never owned a smart watch before. Because I viewed them as geeky, or just not a classic automatic watch. I was walking on the roof last week at work, I got a call, pulled the phone out, and proceeded to drop it and it slid onto a paver. Oddly enough the phone is ok. So this watch enables me to leave my phone in my pocket. Well worth the money!  I also never liked that they turn off and they were way to small for my liking. The bigger face is nice yet not to big! I like the color, not a big fan of the red band so I ordered another one.  If you have never had or wanted an Apple Watch they are much better then the 1st one. I’m sure I’ll like it more as I truly get to understand all of the features.  I got the 6 instead of the se because of the health apps as well as it being more future proof inside.Thank you for reading sorry for rambling on.",

I wore it for 2 days and then the rest of the days it was just sitting on my dresser. It seemed like a chore to put it on all day. Also I had wanted the loop band when I purchased it but they wanted to charge me an extra hundred dollars. Also I was expecting it to be more entertaining but the health alerts were boring and they came at the worst times. I found myself dismissing the alerts rather than following them. Also the OS is not very good. The best things that I liked about the watch to were the charging times and the ECG and that’s it. The pros were not enough for me to justify the $462 that I spent on this watch.",

				"I’ve been an Apple user my whole life. I think my father would roll over in his grave if he knew how much I loathed this product. I’ve never been able to bring myself to pay over $400 for a watch, so I’ve always had a Fitbit. Well, I splurged on this one for myself and my husband since it had new “upgrades” (that were already available with my Ionic). I’ve been wearing it for about a week now and I have to say I’m completely disappointed. The sleep tracking is garbage. It tracks my workouts ok, but seriously why is Standing an important metric? The battery is even worse!! I was able to wear my Ionic for at least six days between charges. You literally have to charge this thing everyday and it takes almost 4 hours to charge after running it down to 2%. Returning this ASAP and getting the new Fitbit Sense. Apple has a lonnnnnggggg way to go to catch up to Fitbit in my opinion. So until they can beef up everything that’s under the hood and be game changers like they are for all my other devices, I won’t be supporting the Apple Watch.",

				"I never thought I would buy an Apple Watch because of the big price for one with all the bells and whistles. However, I had to find a replacement for my defective Fitbit Ionic. I thought why not look into a Apple Watch as I have had an iPhone for many years. I read the reviews and still thought the price is high for a watch and extension of my iPhone. I compared it to the Fitbit and yes the Apple Watch is more than a fitness tracker. It’s a watch and as I mentioned an extension of the iPhone if you have one. I wanted to try out the new ekg feature and be able to talk on my phone from my watch. The reviews about the charging of the Apple Watch are true. I have to charge the watch everyday (I do my charging before bedtime) as by the end of a day of tracking my activities and talking on the watch the battery is at 35-40%. This I have noticed everyday. The Fitbit could go a few days without having to charge. The charging is why I give 4/5 stars for the Apple Watch. The Apple Watch does allow me to add many more activities than the Fitbit to track like dancing. I can swim with my Apple Watch so it says and track that. I listen to my music from the watch paired to my AirPods. The watch was easy to set up and get going out the box. I was able to change the face of the watch to my personal meme and it shows my photos from my iPhone as a screensaver slide show. The band to the watch is different than any watch I’ve ever worn but it is functional and so far durable. The watch has other functions like a breath app for calming which is part of my self care routine (Fitbit has this too). There is the O2 saturation function that is nice (Fitbit has it too). To sum it up it is an extension of the iPhone with the phone and apps but also a watch and fitness tracker. It also has Siri. It was a expensive gift to myself and I don’t think I will go back to Fitbit after this.",

				"Why do people love their Apple Watches? It's just a watch, for pete's sake! But if you have one you know right away. There's a small miracle that happens in a busy life when you can answer your phone (er, watch?) with your hands full. Or just glancing down to see the text message you just got. Or even completing those freaking rings (don't know? of you will). There's very little bad I can say after having my Series 2 for the last couple of years. I'm happy to get the 3 to have the always-on feature of cellular. I can leave the house and it's not even a problem if I left my phone. Or go for a walk without having a heavy phone in my pocket. It's not even about style, there's just a huge practicality of having a small device attached to your wrist that makes so many problems go away. Here are the positives:• Excellent watch. Like, as a watch.• Receive calls. Make calls.• Receive text messages. Facebook, Twitter, IG, and more.• Interchangeable bands. Fit the look you want, change on a dime.• Siri• Alarms, notes and all the other little apps.• Fitness trackingReally, I don't have any cons. I know people think a smart phone in your back pocket is the top, but this just changes the game. I don't know a single person who ever got an Apple Watch and didn't like it. And the funny thing is you'll never know unless you get one - Because how it changes what you do is the thing that makes it amazing. It's all those small little ways that make for a stupidly brilliant product.Seriously, you, your wife, your boyfriend - It make a perfect gift.",

				'Upgraded from a Series 1 to this Series 3.  I can\'t believe the difference in speed!  That alone made the upgrade absolutely worth it!  The move between apps and the messages app are smooth and succinct.  The added features that my old watch did not have are intuitive and time-saving: the raise to talk Siri is perfect and works flawlessly.  Not having to "call out" to Siri is great.  The walkie-talkie feature is a tad clumsy, but works well for a quick check-in to/from my wife while I am at work.  The kids have enjoyed it too when they miss me during the longer days.  While I have not swam with the watch, I have worn it in the shower a handful of times.  The water eject button is quite intelligent.  I think it simply uses sounds waves to push the water out of the speaker port.  You can hear a "wshhh" sound, hearing its effectiveness.  I will say though, the pitch/volume of the eject noise is quite loud...people WILL look!Like many others, I was hesitating between the new Series 4 and this Series 3.  I got it for $229 for Black Friday and simply could not pass up that deal at nearly HALF off a new 4.  I don\'t regret it one bit and am glad I took the plunge!',

				"I've waited to write this review; it took me a while to get used to the new watch. This watch gives me blood ox., heart rate, pressure and a cycling option. I'm not using the sleep tracking. I am happy with the heart rate results; all are in a range I expect. The hour I spend cycling each day provides me with different levels of exercise I have achieved. I look at my time after each mile of my 10-mile ride and the readout is easy to observe. Many different clock faces are available and I've uploaded pic of my dogs as the background. Step count is very slightly generous. The first week I was overly using different measurements and the watch battery lasted 6 days. Now that I'm in a normal routine, it will last 7 days. I am notified of texts, tweets and FB posts as well.My skins seems to have a bad reaction if I wear this 24/7, once sweaty I remove the watch for a period of time and I've stopped wearing over night. This is a personal skin reaction to the watch band.",

I am so impressed with this watch.  I have a very small wrist and was worried this watch would be too big.  It fits my wrist perfectly.  I also want to say that it is very easy to set up and I am not very tech savvy.",

				"I will update once contacting the manufacturer. I've had this for a few days, but just set up yesterday. I recently returned aless expensive one as I really was not interested in graphs  and other \"additives\". I just want to start keeping track of my steps. And, frankly, I loved all the choices of the watch faces. I ALWAYS read reviews prior to my making a purchase, and this closed the deal for me. While getting ready to go with my Mom to her Drs. appt. this am, I noticed I was up to 800+ steps. I barely left the bathroom. It takes me about 10-15 min. to style my hair. I pondered... perhaps it was the movement of my arms that the watch was sensing as 'step movement'? I don't know. It's a question for the company. If this is the case, not sure I'll keep it. I know, it's only a slight \"picky-uny\" inconvenience\", but I may decide to just forego the 'smartwatch' altogether'.Update :  Just received email from the company and it does seem the watch DOES pick up ANY arm movement and counts it as a step. I suppose I could remove the watch before /after doing my hair. Even though I returned the previous watch, it did not count my arm movement while fixing my hair. Strange...? Alas... no more of  these watches for me.",

I love the reminders to drink water and to get up and move.  it’s a nice watch for the price. It syncs with my health app on iPhone and with my smart watch which has been so helpful.

				"I bought this watch for my father-in-law (70+) because he wanted to start tracking his steps, heart rate, etc...  The intent was to buy something at a lower price-point to see if he liked it and would stick to it, and then upgrade to a higher dollar one at Christmas.  He is a dinosaur and electronics are not his strong suit.  He loves this watch, and picked up the functions of it very quickly.  He tells my husband everyday how far he's walked that day, what his blood pressure is, and so on, and so on.  Getting him to respond to a text in a fair amount of time has always been hit or miss.  Not anymore.  He sees his texts pop up on his phone. He does not want an upgrade.  He loves it!  All we had to do in the beginning was download the app on his phone, and have Bluetooth accept his watch... and that's it!  We did not show him how to use it or anything.  I know it's not an iWatch... but, we are VERY happy with this purchase.",

I called the Cricket customer service and every time I called  they told me something new. I just wanted to keep the same phone number that I have been using for years with Metro. Besides the Cricket SIM Card didn’t work, they said the SIM card is the correct one but I needed a new card and they told me to request another card through Amazon with no explanation why the first one didn’t work. But I was afraid a new SIM card could’t work either. So because the disappointing Cricket customer service I had to return a nice good iPhone eleven 😞. I returned the phone on January 22, It means  seven weeks ago and I’m still waiting for my money back. I  don’t recommend this Cricket on line. I had to get in person on another carrier and they did all the job & I can keep the same phone #.",

I know this hard to believe but I searched every where on the phone for it and it's not there.  I also did numerous web searches and the Wi-Fi call option is not where it is shown on the videos. I use Consumer Cellular and they couldn't help me since it is not a commonly used phone.Be aware there is no online support. There is a forum and you can submit a comment via an app on the phone.  But there is nothing saying they will get back to you.  I have submitted comments through both of these but have not heard back.  If I do hear back with a fix, I will revise this review.  Otherwise I'm sending the phone back.Never heard from them so I got a refund from Amazon.  I should note that the cellular calls were fine but the wifi calling is important to me.

				"UPDATE: 6/19/21 I just wanted to update because my daughter just brought her headphones home from school for summer vacation and they are in great condition. Even the cords & the ear pads, which always seem to be the first to go. My daughter said she wants to still use these next year since they're so comfortable, especially while she's wearing her glasses. Honestly, one school year is what I'd hope to get from these at this value. I'm kind of excited they're still going strong!UPDATE: 10/14/20 Bought a 2nd pair for our 3rd grader to use at school. Originally, we bought her the lightweight, on ear styled, Koss brand headphones on here, but she thought they were too tight and uncomfortable to wear for any length of time. Especially because she wears glasses, and now a mask as well. She loved these tho! Said they felt great, and has been using them at school for just over 6weeks with no problems.ORIGINAL: We bought these for my mother in-law to use with her t.v. because she is starting to become hard of hearing. We wanted to check everything out before setting everything up for her, and we found these were made well, had good sound volume and quality, were comfortable for a decent length of time, and overall were good headphones. She wanted to have two different styles. These were the one style that she was able to use in her 3.5mm tablet as well, which was an added bonus. She had hoped both pairs would work in her tablet, but the on ear computer style Panasonic did not fit, but still works for the t.v. set up, which was her main concern. The Panasonic had a smaller pin, so it might have worked in a cell phone. She did not try it, but I will update once she does. I wish we had thought to try ourselves. We purchased everything on Amazon for her setup. This pair fit all of our heads and have a lot of adjustability. They do show which way to put them on by marking the back of the ear pad section with \"L\" for left & \"R\" right, as shown in my photos. These are decently padded, and if taken care of should last. Overtime, this padded material may start to crack and chip away, but they're pretty good for this value. The Panasonic ones were more lightweight when wearing for long periods, so she's still glad she got both pair. We waited 2mnths to review so she had a chance to really use these and see how they worked, and we told her we'd return them if needed, but she is happy with them. They've really helped with her quality of life. She had stopped watching t.v. for a time because she just couldn't hear it anymore, so I'm happy the volume and sound quality was good enough so she could use them daily. We may order another pair of these for our daughter. I will update if these fail. I hope my pictures help give you an idea of what to expect in person.",

				"I had a pair from this headphone line in the past, and used them until they basically fell apart (one side stopped working, and the cushioning material for the ears eventually peeled away.)  And yet after trying myriad other brands, I rate these as my personal best.  After my first pair died (took several years of daily use), I went on a quest to try a bunch of different headphones.  After wasting hundreds of dollars over the past couple years on everything from fancy $200 pairs, cheap Amazon-branded pairs, and plenty of random ones from places like Big Lots or Walmart, I finally just came back to these for a meager $15.  There's simply no beating the combination of comfort (especially for people with glasses!), sound quality, and price.  I work in front of a computer for hours at a time, and almost always have headphones (and eye glasses) on.  I probably have a larger than average head shape too.  Every single other pair I have tried ended up making my ears hurt before long, except this one.  While the construction quality is decent, I do expect to run through a new pair every couple years, but at this price point, it's really hard to complain.  In summary, I am so thankful these are back in my life.",

				"These phones sound really nice, for being under $20. I have owned at least 30 different headphones since 1974, and these sound as good as any of the $100 Sennheisers I had back when Elton John's \"Rocket Man\" was new music. The power requirement for the voice coils in these phones is remarkably low: They sound great for listening to music on a cell phone or tablet, and you won't even have to crank the volume up to maximum. Some of the headphones I have owned recently don't work well with mobile devices, requiring more output power than the audio chip in a cell phone can provide - that won't be a problem with these Sony ZX-110 phones. They sound just fine on my Samsung Galaxy Tab S at 50% of max volume. Frequency response is very good for economy priced phones, with clear treble and adequate bass response to let you \"feel\" the drums and bass guitar. Soprano and contralto vocals sound nice and clear, without that \"muddy\" sound that cheap phones give that don't have enough high-frequency response. These phones fold up into a very small, compact footprint that is easy to store in a medium or large purse, or any briefcase, backpack, or laptop computer bag. The cord is 3 feet, and has a 90° angled plug. This cord length is great for use with a cell phone in a shirt pocket, although not really long enough for home use with a desktop computer. If you are going to use these phones to listen to music on a home stereo or desktop computer, you will need an extension cord, but these aren't terribly expensive.COMFORT: Sony got this right: these phones grip your head just firmly enough to stay in place, without squeezing you to death. I have had a couple of Sony phones that were horrible in this respect, with way too much compression on an average sized head; that's not a problem with these phones. The ear pads are very comfortable, and they don't press hard enough on your earlobes to make you need to take your earrings off to use the phones.SUMMARY: A Typical Sony economy-priced headphone with much better sound than you might have expected at this price point. Folds up very small for carrying in a purse or laptop computer bag, Very comfortable to wear for up to several hours.PRODUCT RECOMMENDATION: HIGHLY RECOMMENDED",

				"These are great headphones for music and movies for the price.  I have never owned a big-money pair of headphones & after buying cheap ones that I had to replace multiple times due to breakage, I decided to get these after a recommendation from a friend.  After buying them for myself, I also bought them for each of my kids.  They're great for average use... i've never been bothered by outside noise, they are comfortable, and the sound is of good quality.  They also are much sturdier than the cheapie $10-$20 ones I've gotten before.  (My kids haven't broken them, which is a minor miracle)I do recommend getting a bag or carrying case for them (I use a Crown Royal bag:) it certainly helps protect them and they do seem vulnerable at the hinges where they collapse for storage.The only thing my kid complains about is the wire is kind of short. I prefer it because the wire is nice and thick and never gets tangled.  with my previous cheap ones, it was always the wires that were delicate & one or both ears would go out.  These are so much sturdier. (I think he just finds them too short when he wants to sit in the recliner with his iPad on the table & watch his Minecraft. If you don't require your headphones to meet these specific and ridiculous needs, the length should be fine.)",

Dynamic range is within it's price range. A reasonable value for a knock around set of headphones. The vinyl coating over the ear covers has worn off on both sides and the covering flakes off onto you when you wear them. I guess it might have been affected by how I must put them on and off.

Sound quality is mediocre, but these are a heck of a lot better than dealing w/ the tears-inducing migraine that comes from headphones that squeeze my ears and jaw. They're not as comfortable as they claim to be, but markedly more comfortable than the Amazon Basics ones of similar appearance. If you're looking for something practical, and can handle a very short cord, like if you're on your laptop, these are for you. Wouldn't use them for exercise or movement of any sort. I'll  probably buy them again, if they randomly short out on me. I'd say they're worth the $15 I paid, but if the price goes up, I won't buy them again. :) -Account holder's progeny",

				"I made a mistake. The original Earpods that came with my Apple iPhone 6 Plus started cutting out. I decided for the cheaper option of the Amazon headphones rather than a slightly more expensive Earpod replacement.  I now regret that decision.The Amazon headphones are not even CLOSE to the same comfort, fit, quality as the Apple Earpods.  No matter how I tried, I just couldn't fit the Amazon headphones in my ear. I tried the different sizes and twisted. They would stay in a few minutes and then pop out.  It was a disaster for exercising.I found the Amazon headphones very uncomfortable. They didn't just sit in the ears like the Apple Earpods.  They had to be squeezed inside the ear canal. Obviously Apple (and all manufactures) have patents on their designs that Amazon cannot copy.  So, Amazon must have been very limited in their choice of design.  It's just NOT good.  And it plugged the ears so much that I heard my breathing and heartbeat.  Once I put them in, I couldn't wait to get them back out.The sound quality is garbage. It's not even CLOSE to the quality of the Apple Earpods.  The sound is loud, but very harsh and tinny. I guess if I never had any headphones before and used the Amazon headphones, I would probably just accept it because I had nothing to compare it to.  However, I had the Apple Earpods, so I could make a direct comparison.  It's not even close. So, I went ahead and ordered another Apple Earpods - which is only about $5 more.  I should have done that initially.  I cannot recommend the Amazon headphones.",

These may very well be an extremely well-crafted fake, but I can't tell the difference. The claim about the cord being slicker than the Apple store ones is false too btw.

				'After losing my iPhone7 EarPods, I bought these replacements---crossing my fingers that these would be legit Apple products (my order was "Sold by Amazon" new as a Prime Exclusive). I miraculously found my original EarPods so when these arrived I compared them directly to see whether they matched up. The ones Amazon sent me are just like the ones I got with my phone, and the packaging is just like all my other classic Apple stuff: everything sealed, meticulously held in place, documentation, etc.Photos below show all the box details and the packaged EarPods. The only thing that seemed slightly different was the thickness of the main cord---these are a tiny bit thinner it feels like (but I got my IPhone7 some time ago so these might be the "current" version). As for sound, I can\'t tell any difference between my original EarPods and these replacements.  My one star off is because the shape of the actual earpiece is not my favorite. That\'s just preference---or ear size, maybe?UPDATE: looks like Amazon isn\'t always offering these as Prime-Exclusive, or at all. I would never go for these if listed by others, new or used.

				"I purchased these and the Sony WH1000XM2 to compare the two. Cnet says they both have a \"9\" for sound quality. I would agree, they both sound excellent. The Bose won the test for its noise cancellation, performance talking to people on the phone, comfort on my head, and sound processing.Phone performance:I compared how the Bose and the Sony sounded when recording and playing back my voice with a fan running in the background. The Bose sounded like I was holding an old fashioned handset and talking in a quiet room - intimate and zero background noise. The Sony sounded like I was on speaker phone, and I could hear some background noise. (As a control I also recorded using neither and it sounded like I was on speaker but also I could hear more background noise.) This feature is important to me since I spend a lot of time on the phone and prefer my clients to not hear any background noise.Sound qualityThe Bose and Sony both have excellent sound quality for playing music. I personally prefer the sound the Sony produces. The Sony iphone app lets you choose your levels on an equalizer, and I like that. However, the Bose hears what type of music you're playing and automatically optimizes the sound, and it does a really good job. While I would prefer to be able to set the levels if I so choose, I also appreciate that Bose is making it all easy for me, so I can truly listen to my music on random and not have to fuss with levels. The Bose iphone app doesn't do very much at all. It does let you \"find your headset\" similar to the \"find my phone\" app, and it will apply firmware. (I'm hoping Bose will add an equalizer into its app in the future.)Noise cancellationThe Sony occasionally made me aware that noise cancellation was going on (with a whitenoise effect). The Bose on the other hand just stops the noise. There is no delay, no white noise, just quiet and your music.ControlsThe Bose controls are intuitive to find and to use. I like that the on-off control is a switch to flip on and off (rather than a button to find). Also, you can use this button to switch between devices, for example between your phone and ipad and your TV amplifier. The right earcup has three small buttons in a row together, and they control a lot of things. Volume, pause, and skip, rewind, answer/decline calls, etc. The left earcup only has the google assistant button, which I programmed to instead control the amount of noise cancellation (high, low, off). Song playback sounds much better with noise cancellation on high, and I don't think that has to do with noise (I was in a quiet environment); the bass sounds enhanced with noise cancellation on for some reason. (In comparison, the Sony lets you swipe the earcup itself to control volume, pause, play, skip, etc. This seems great in theory, but in practice if I bumped  the earcup adjusting my glasses or whatever, the music would pause. I found the Sony to be somewhat buggy in that regard. It would stop playing at times and I had to pick up my phone to get the music re-started, which is annoying.) I found the Bose controls to be more intuitive and consistent. Also, when you switch them on a voice tells you how much battery you have left, which is handy.ComfortThe Bose QuietComfort truly is comfortable. The earcups are soft, there is not a lot of clamping, and the top band is padded so it's less annoying on the top of the head.  (In comparison, the Sony do have more clamping which was uncomfortable over glasses.) I am a pilot and wear a similar headset, so I'm familiar with how headphones feel after a few hours. On-ear are not going to be as comfortable for long term wear as earbuds would be, but I was wiling to make that trade-off to get superior sound quality.StyleThe Bose are more streamlined to my head. the Sony are bulky and look geeky.ConclusionEven though the Sony produces superior sound, the litany of other features (superior noise cancellation, intuitive controls, comfort, style, & phone performance) won me over to the Bose.",

I played various background noise on my speakers and there was no difference between low and high ANC. Bluetooth skipped every 2 seconds if both Mac and iPhone were connected whereas it worked seamlessly before. Symptoms didn't go away after updating to the 3.1.8 firmware via Bose's website.

				"These are amazing and Bose is great!  I purchased these headphones for their noise-cancellation abilities.  I am an application developer and wear them at work because I am easily distracted.  I don't even listen to music with them... they just cancel just about all background noise, including random chatter from the annoying marketing department.  I also use them for WebEx and Skype calls with clients.  The built-in microphone is great and the noise-cancellation is helpful during those calls as well.  Battery life is extremely good.  I can go an entire week without having to charge the headset.  It comes with an 1/8\" cable that will allow you to listen to music even when the batteries are dead.  An added feature is that the bluetooth feature will allow you to connect to and hear audio from two sources at the same time.  This is great if you want to connect to your iPhone and laptop at the same time.After a month of use, the headphones button would no longer work to pair to a new device.  It would still power on and off, just the pairing didn't function.  Bose support was difficult to deal with.  At first the support technician didn't think there was anything wrong with the headset.  After a frustrating conversation, he relented and sent me instructions for sending them back to the manufacturer.  This would mean that I would be without my precious headphones for at least two weeks.  The next day prior to dropping the headphones at UPS I came across The Bose Store at Tysons Corner Mall.  I had the headphones with me so I decided to speak to one of the employees there.  After a very brief conversation, and even though I purchased these through Amazon, he walks over to a display, gets me a brand new set of headphones and proceeds to exchange my defective ones for the new set.  No other questions asked.  He just said \"We like to take care of our customers\".  I wish customer support would have been as easy to deal with... but, things worked out.",

Check out the 1-star ratings on Amazon and you'll see what I am describing here.  After 2 headsets with 100% failure, I know this is not a fluke.  This flaw is built-in and designed into the headset hardware/firmware/software.I called Bose Tech support.  They took me through a process to turn off the headset for 30 seconds, plug it in to the charger for 5 seconds, then unplug from USB charger and turn on again. This is very rudimentary.  I have unpair, rebooted device, drained the headset battery, reloaded the Bose App, resynch to my phone many times, airplane mode, turned off bluetooth, tried on different phones, computers tablets, ... in the end, it all fails.Bose Tech support was good, though.

				"OK, my personal comparison of the Sony WH-1000Xm2 and the Bose is complete. After reading all the reviews, the Sony seemed to win out, but with Amazon's generous return policy, I purchased both and did a several hour comparison yesterday. Both are great, but here's what pushed me over the edge for Bose.1. Sound. I am not an audiophile so the terms I use in this section to describe what I experienced may be technically incorrect terms, so bear with me. The Bose sound is amazing. It is crisp and clean and full. I can hear so much more in the same music I have been listening to for years. It's hard to explain but the Sony seemed compressed while the Bose feels full. The highs are better on the Bose and the there is separation in the music. The bass on the Sony seems louder, but not crisp and clean like it does on the Bose. The Sony sound is very good but compressed and almost muddy compared to the Bose. I know reviews say the Sony sounds better, but I just don't hear it that way. I found myself cutting my Sony tests short so I could go back to the Bose.2. Comfort. The Bose is lighter and more comfortable for me. The Sony felt heavy in comparison.Every other feature became unimportant to me after hearing the sound and feeling the comfort. Both eliminated noise and did everything else fine.Nothing against the Sony WH-1000Xm2 - it is an excellent product, but for me I'm keeping the Bose and sending back the Sony's.",

				'I was in between Sony WH 1000XM2 and Bose QC35 II. After spending hours on watching/reading all the reviews, comparisons, I chose Bose over Sony, although almost all professional reviewers rated Sony higher than Bose. Let me do a quick review and explain why I did so:i) Sound Quality: 8/10. Very "clean" sound. Definitely high quality and pleasing. In fact, it can be described as "calming". Not very base heavy. But my main use for this headphone is to cut the background noise and listen to a relaxing music while I am working/studying in a cafe. Therefore, keeping my aim in mind, the sound quality is right on target.ii) Noise Cancellation: 8/10. It cuts out most of the outside noises. But, don\'t expect miracles as some people describe. For example, if somebody talks, you definitely hear them. There is also a slight pressure in my ears due to ANC, but I got used to it pretty quickly.iii) Comfort: 9/10. The best one in the market in terms of comfort. Especially compared to my Plantronics Backbeat Pro. However, after wearing it for an hour or so, my ears still get warm to a level that I have to take off for a while. This was a surprise to me given all the positive reviews regarding the comfort of Bose QC35II.iv) Call Quality 6/10: As mentioned in most of the reviews, Bose pick up external noise during phone calls. It is not to a level to prevent communication. However it certainly disturbs the other party. Compared to my Plantronics, this was not an issue at all on my Plantronics. People could not figure out whether I was using my headphones or not. So, if you are purchasing Bose for all day long phone calls at work, chose another headphones.v) Features: 3/10. We all know that Sony has many more features (touchpad control of songs, adaptive noise cancelling, quick attention mode, etc.)  than Bose. To me they are not essential but nice to have. Especially quick attention mode. When somebody talks to me while wearing Bose, I do have to remove it which is a hassle. In my Plantronics, I could have handle those situations without removing headphone. Another important feature is multi-device connection simultaneously. That was one of the reasons why I did not chose Sony. I was hoping to connect to both my laptop and phone at the same time. However this feature is not working as it should. When I connect both my laptop and phone and try to listen to a song on my laptop, it doesn\'t play smoothly at all. It stops and starts at every 3-5 seconds by itself as if there is a problem with data transfer speed. And after 1-2 mins, my laptop (Dell XPS 13) crashes (it crashed 4 times within 30 mins). And let me tell you this. I have been using my laptop for the last 2 years. And it has not crashed even once until now. It is also up to date; all Windows & Dell driver updates are installed. Long story short, I can\'t connect Bose to both my laptop and phone as of now. I hope Bose solves this with a firmware update ASAP.Regarding bluetooth connection strength, it is worse than my Plantronics. It disconnects at shorter distances that Plantronics and once it does, it does not automatically reconnects when I get closer to my device which Plantronics always did without any problems.vi) Final Verdict: 7.5/10: Bose is a good headphones with some flaws and major weaknesses. It is far from perfect as many reviewers/users wholeheartedly claim. To be satisfied with your purchase, you need to decide what features in a headphone is  most important for you and what will be your main use. If it is the best sound quality or call quality, or if you want the most feature packed cook headset, skip Bose. You will hate it. If you more care the noise cancellation and comfort and then a clean sound, then go for it.I hope this helps...',

				"I didn't buy these headphones through Amazon but I thought I would leave a review for these anyway.When I was shopping for a quality pair of noise-cancelling headphones, it really came down to a few choices. Watching a lot of youtube reviews and reading a lot of online reviews, it narrowed down to choosing the Bose QC35 IIs and the Sony WH1000XM2. When it comes down to the best noise-cancelling and the best comfort, there were a lot of debates between the two. And, when choosing headphones, I think it's important to consider what you want in a pair of really expensive headphones.For me, comfort was an absolute priority. A lot of headphones can give users wearer's fatigue and can become hot and uncomfortable after some time. When I'm using them to study or through plane rides, I wanted to make sure that whichever pair I bought would be the most comfortable.In the end, I decided on Bose because of how light-weight they were. The Bose QC35 IIs are about 8.1oz (~230g) in weight and the Sony headphones are about 9.7oz (~275g). They might not seem like a huge difference, but that comparison is for you as a future consumer to make.So far, wearing the QC35 IIs have given me the best wearing experience out of any of the headphones I've tried previously. I can go hours with them on without feeling much discomfort and because they are so light-weight, sometimes I forget that they're even on.What's also great about these in particular is that these cover your entire ear. The plush for the L/R ears actually sits around your ears instead of sitting partly on your ears. When I tested the Sony headphones at Best Buy, the headphones sat partly on my ears and after ten minutes of testing them, I had the sense that they might become uncomfortable after some time. This was also one of the big reasons I chose to go with Bose instead Sony.The active noise cancelling is one of the best on the market today and personal experience tells me that the ANC is amazing, but plenty of reviews have said that Sony either matches or beats Bose in the ANC department. Because I don't own a pair of the WH1000XM2, I can't really comment on which is better. The QC35 IIs, however, blocks out nearly all ambient noises and is a pleasure to use in noisy environments. Some have said that the ANC can give them headaches due to a cabin-like pressure attributed to the ANC. It took a day or so to adjust to the ANC and that \"cabin-like pressure\" and it doesn't bother me personally anymore, but so I would head to your local Best Buy or electronics store to test this for yourself. These headphones are a huge expenditure, so it's important to test whether or not this might apply to you.Pros:Incredibly lightweight and comfortableCompletely surrounds your ear instead of sitting partly on top of your earsANC is amazing that blocks out all ambient noises20-hour battery lifeCons:\"Cabin-like pressure\" that may cause headaches for some usersSound quality may not be up to far for some audiophiles (some reviewers have noted that Sony has better sound quality)TLDR:If comfort is your top priority and you're not the biggest audiophile, I would absolutely recommend Bose.",

				"I have now had two of these sets of headphones and am in the process of returning the second. I'm writing this review in comparison to a set of Plantronics BB Pro 2 headphones that were separately connected to the same devices as this Bose headset, so the issue is definitely the headset and not the device.First device:- Noise cancelling worked sometimes in one ear, sometimes in both, and sometimes in neither.- The headset would randomly emit a death screech at maximum volume in one ear.After returning the first device, I thought that there was no chance I'd get a defective product twice in a row. I was wrong.Second device:- In a 15 minute period, I experienced 4 random power flickers which resulted in the device power cycling, announcing battery level, and reconnecting to the device it lost connection to.I'm really disappointed with the quality level of these considering they are a ~300$ premium device. Hitting 1 quality issue happens, but two devices in a row is absurd. In contrast, I've had my other noise cancelling set for years and it has no issues. It's unfortunate as this device has a lot of positives (good battery, great sound, easy to use, nice carrying case and compact fold pattern) but none of them matter if the device doesn't work. 1 star.",

Of course, saying that ANYTHING from Apple is "value for the money" is darn near laughable.

Apple does a better job of internet security than PCs (or droids or whatever), and it\'s always very quick and easy to install apps. But, trouble-shooting things like mail can be a headache.',

				"I bought this computer in May, with upgraded RAM and storage, as I do video editing as well as other media work. I paid more than $3300 for it. It has been defective since I got it. It started with blue and purple lines across the screen two days after I received it. I reset the PRAM and it seemed to solve. But there have been constant problems with the video/graphics card. About one out of four times when I load a video the screen freezes. When I have tried to record from the screen the whole computer crashes and turns off, then when I boot back up it is frozen. I have called six times about this.My only option is to send the computer back in and have them work on it for two weeks. Today when I called I was on hold for 43 minutes. When I asked to speak to a supervisor, I was back on hold, she said four words and disconnected. I got an email saying they had \"tried to call me back.\" They did not such thing. I called back and was on hold for 48 minutes.Amazing to me that any company would take $3300 from me, deliver a clearly defective product, and not replace it with a product that is not defective. Two weeks without a computer means I don't work. I will be taking my old computer to Geek Squad and getting it fixed before I sent it off, spending $500 to have a computer so I can work. In my book Apple is just not standing by its product here and it's on me to deal with it.I have used Macs for more than 20 years. This is my fourth Macbook. In the past they have been fantastic, reliable, I would not use anything else for graphics. But this product is clearly defective and Apple's customer service has gone down the tubes.",

I am a full time college student as well as a single mother who stays busy. I have previously used a HP All In one computer that I bought brand new a year ago and I hate that thing... It is so slow!!! When I first opened this item, I was just hoping that it would be a little faster! What I got instead was an amazing computer that is faster than I could have ever imagined. Now I don't use this thing for much more than amazon reviews, school work, and papers. But this is exactly what I needed.\n\nIt navigated quickly between web pages, my Microsoft word programs opens instantly and doesn't take forever to load like my HP does. The picture of this monitor is just beautiful. Everything is so clear. I love that the keyboard has a back light so I can see the keys if I need to take a look at them while I am typing, but the back lights go away after a few seconds, so if you are watching a movie, the lit up key board will not bother you.\n\nThis computer is so light weight and easy to carry. I love the sleek design of it as well. This would be a great computer for anyone who just needs a basic computer for the internet or spreadsheets. I would feel at ease taking this computer with me to college or sending it off to college with my children, and I wouldn't worry if they had the ability to complete their assignments in school.

				"This is the best laptop deal you can get, full stop.Touchescreen? Nope. That feature is stupid in a laptop, in my view. As you use the keyboard, incidental touche s of the screen change focus or move to different screens--touchscreen is a gimmick and sucks.The screen on this laptop is worth the price by itself. Gorgeous, black is actually black, it rivals my AOC gaming desktop monitor.The Ryzen chip inside can be overclosked if you feel like it, but it is not needed. It is plenty fast for a laptop.This is set up to add memory and a hard drive. Do so. I spent an additional $50 to add a 1tb drive and an 8gig memory stick.  In so doing, I have the same specs as a $700 consumer laptop.Gaming? I stream from my desktop, it's perfect. It won't run any modern games at more than low settings (if that) but you don't need to run them onboard if you have a gaming machine. DO NOT BUY THIS TO PLAY GAMES ONBOARD. Stream via Steam, it's perfect.Buy this for $300, spend an additional $50 or $100 on memory and storage, and sit back and realize that you got a premier laptop for 1/3 the money people are spending on nothing.Build quality is bomber. Eveything is solid, no rattles, no warps. Others have ripped on the touchpad--can't tell the difference between this and any other laptop touchpad. It isn't loose, responds as usual, no problem.The screen is GORGEOUS and much better than laptops at twice or three times the price.I actually like the compressed number pad on the right. If you aren't doing a lot of 10-key stuff, it's what you need.The keyboard backlight stays on while you're typing, shuts off when you aren't. Perfectly configured.This boots in about 15 seconds.It has some heft, but is still very light. Hard to describe, but you can carry this all day in your backpack and not even know it is there. The power brick is about the size of a Toblerone tube. I plan on buying an extra to travel with.This will work as a consumer laptop as is, like I said, but add some memory and a hard drive and you are CRUSHING.I can't sing the praises of this enough.Buy this, add a drive and a memory stick and you get a premier laptop for less than $400. And you get a better screen, too. And anyone can do that, it isn't tough at all. If you can turn a screwdriver, you can update this machine.Make sure to go in and turn S mode off. First, activate Windows, then go to the store and turn off S mode.This is much better than what other companies are offering as a budget laptop.",

				"A very reasonably priced laptop for basic computing needs. The specs that stick out to me for describing this as \"basic needs\" is 4GB of RAM, and 128GB M.2 SSD. Both are at the bare minimum in today's needs. Cell phones now come with those specs( high dollar ones though..).Seems like one of the goals of this laptop is to keep an aesthetically pleasing design. Just 1 3.1 USB port and 2 2.0 USB ports are included, one headphone/mic jack, 1 slim RJ45 port, HDMI, and power input plug. No external battery.2 things that stuck out to me when I started using: screen and sound quality. The screen is very sharp and high contrast. Black is actually black. Very impressed. I was also surprised by the audio quality. I don't expect much from laptop speakers, especially low priced ones, but was pleasantly surprised on how clear the audio is.The back panel of the laptop does not have any easy access ports to swap out hard drives or RAM. Instead, you remove 10 or so Philips screws to remove the entire panel. I've already swapped out the 4GB RAM stick for an 8GB. Easy enough.The laptop includes an M.2 SSD. The pro to this is you still have the option of adding a traditional sized disk to expand your storage, without needing to worry about reinstalling an OS or attempting to clone the included drive.Almost puked when I thought I was locked-in to \"S Mode\" When I went to unlock S-mode, Windows kindly directly me to pay >$100 to purchase a license! I was furious thinking this was some new scheme to sell laptops without a full legitimate Windows license and instead lock you into a Microsoft only app store. I forget the exact steps I took, but somewhere I found that there was an error in activating my Windows license, and I had to click a troubleshoot button, then it magically worked and got me out of S mode. Disaster averted.A couple of things that annoy me:-The touchpad feels a little loose to me. Just gently touching it causes it to move and you can hear a plastic on plastic sound, its distracting...-The keyboard backlight turns off after a set amount of time, you must press a key for it to illuminate again. Moving the mouse/touchpad does not cause the keys to light up. You must touch a key. I see the is a BIOS option for disabling the timeout. I've disabled it but it appears to have no effect. It still turns off.-The slim-line RJ45 port seems messed up... I pull the flap down and it does not open far enough to insert a connector. I will probably never use it.. but what gives?",

				"A few months after the purchase....It is still running good and I bought 5 more for my colleagues, so I bought all together 8 machines.  My of my colleagues need more memory while some need less.  So what I do is, for those who need more, I took the 4GB RAM out from their machine and put it in the machine of the colleague who needs less.  So 1 machine got 2x4G running in dual channel with identical RAM and install a new 2x8G for the original machine.  To be honest, difference for 4 to 8 is high, but little difference from 8 to 16.  So those in a tight budget can save your money._____________________This laptop is great.  For this price, there is nothing to complain.I use this for basic computer needs at home.  What I will do with is just Office, surfing, youtube, netflix.  This computer handles it really well, all very smoothly.What I like most is the screen.  It is IPS.  At this price point (310 for me), most laptops are bundled with TN display, which be honestly is a deal breaker.  The screen here is gorgeous.  I do not see much difference to my gaming laptop which cost me thrice.  Sound is good, keyboard design average.  I don't like the small num pad.  Some people complained on the backlight, but I don't need this function.  But the num lock indicator, however, is important but wasn't there.On the spec, there is just 4G of RAM.  You can, however, upgrade it easily.  There are 10 screws at of back.  Open it and you can add another slot of RAM and another HDD.  My recommendation, upgrade to 8 or 16G and add another SDD drive immediately after the setup is done as 128G storage will not be enough.  For gaming, I am yet to test it, but at 310, don't expect anything.Ar..  the Windows S issue, google Windows S Switch and you will know how to change it back to Windows 10 Home.  It is just a few clicks and a few minutes.  Everyone can do it.After all, a great computer.  My family members ordered 2 when they see mine.  Highly recommend.",

				"BUYER BE AWARE: This computer has Microsoft 10S. This is scam software by Microsoft to force you to use only Microsoft apps from their deserted island wasteland of an app store. The computer will not allow you to do anything else. You can upgrade to a full version of Microsoft 10... for another $134. Hard pass. STAY AWAY from ALL computers with Microsoft 10S!! Absolute garbage software.",

				"I got this for my ten year old son because it's a great laptop for kids. It has a solid state hard drive which means there's no moving parts and it can take more abuse. In other words I'm not going to worry when my son throws this into his backpack. It's also pretty lightweight and portable.I was, however, a little on the fence about S mode. So what is this? It's a locked down version of Windows 10. It is somewhat limiting in that you can't just run any program you want, it has to be a program solely from the windows store. For example, you have to use Bing as your search engine. You have to use Microsoft Edge as your web browser. For those who are interested in programming, you can't use command-line shells. Pretty limiting right? But the advantage is that the laptop is safer from viruses and malware since there is so much control over what programs can be used. It's very stable and \"safe.\" If it tells you anything, Microsoft markets S-mode laptops to schools because of this safety and stability. Now you can easily scrap the S mode at anytime, but once you leave S mode you can't come back.Other things of note: Upon startup the default settings really lets Microsoft snoop on every little thing you do. I had to disable much of this. If you are handing this over to a kid, I would recommend you do the same. But otherwise, startup was very easy. Cortana talks to you and after you've answered some questions (literally, you can speak the answers) everything is set up.I did notice the speakers are very weak, but honestly I am seldom impressed with laptop speakers. That's when Bluetooth speakers come into play and you can do that easily with this. The screen is not a touch-screen which, I suppose, at this price point you can't really expect.I also saw this laptop has a night setting, which I love. Starting at 8pm, the display minimizes blue light so as not to mess with your body's sleep cycle. That, to me, was a HUGE plus!So would I recommend this? If you are a computer programmer or hope for your kid to be a computer programmer than no, absolutely not. But if you're just wanting to use a computer without necessarily knowing how the parts and software work then YES! This would be a GREAT laptop for you! I can also see this as a great tool for senior citizens as well because if how user-friendly everything is set up to be.",

				"*UPDATE : The labtop completely died near end of warranty, would not charge or power up. Acer replaced motherboard, about 2 weeks turn around time.-The only down side is the 4 gb of ram. 128 nvme is AMAZING at this price, makes the labtop amazingly snappy. Reads are in 1.3-1.4 GB/s range.The display is great for the price, viewing angles are fantastic. Perfect for media consumption. Easily comparable with labtops 2-2.5 times the price. This is bar far my #1 reason for keeping the machine. speakers arent great though, have bluetooth headphones handy.I was able to put POP OS 19 on it without an issue, everything worked perfectly and its very snappy. Due to the nvme you are going to get amazing snappiness.Fully upgradable! There is a included screws to mount 2.5 drive in the box, you can switch wifi card , add another stick  of ram , or swap the M.2.Ram runs at 2400 based on platform, so dont bother with expensive stuff.  The included one is rated at 2666.Stays cool since its a small chip. Fan isnt loud at 100%.Battery life lasts about 3-3.5 hours underload with brightness at 40%.I was able to run dawn of war ii and a few other older games at medium 1080P at half decent frame rates on linux, older games forsure though.Keyboard is good  , much better than idealpad3XX and swift3. I've seen much worst on  much  more expensive devices.I actually really like the aluminium cover, makes the device look premium.This is great machine to consume videos and do light typing without being frustrated by cost or the performance, A+ Acer for putting every dollar where it makes the user experience pleasant .",

				'The Acer 5 slim is sleek, beautiful, durable, lightweight, lightning fast (when upgraded to 16gb of ram), and has a ridiculously low price tag. It probably wouldn\'t be of much use for gaming or CAD, but for basic web browsing, office use, and video streaming, it will do well. I have added some pictures next to a macbook air for size comparison. The screen is bright and beautiful, offering 1080p resolution. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the keyboard lights up! I plan to use this laptop mainly to stream business news, news tickers, and follow several stocks on multiple tabs. For this reason, I knew the RAM upgrade would be necessary. This PC would likely be quite slow if you chose to keep the 4GB of RAM, as 2GB is shared memory. I would recommend at the very least adding another 4GB stick, as there is a slot available and a 4GB stick is quite cheap. I decided to add a second hard drive as well, 128GB is not much, if I recall correctly, only 98GB was available, and that was before any Windows updates!I spent an extra $116 on the following upgrades:Teamgroup 16GB (8GBx2) - 2666MHz , DDR4 Dual-channel laptop memory, and a Kingston 480GB A400 SATA 3 2.5" Internal SSD hard drive. The fact that Acer made this laptop with 2 memory slots and a spot for a second harddrive is part of the reason this laptop has been a bestseller for so long. Without these options I wouldn\'t have considered purchasing it. I have included pictures of the laptop with the back cover removed, at various stages of adding the Kingston 2.5" SATA harddrive. It is an incredibly easy procedure, but I thought some may benefit from the photos. A bag of screws to secure the harddrive actually came with the laptop, which I included it in one of the photos. Replacing the memory is straightforward. To remove the back panel to access the internals, you simply remove 10 phillips screws.After installing the second hard drive, you will probably need to head over to disk management to partition the new drive. Be very careful with this step, as you can really mess your computer up & delete data, if you click on the wrong things! I haven\'t installed a second hard drive in ages, I expected windows to gind the drive after the installation, but that wasn\'t the case for me!This PC includes Microsoft Windows 10 in S mode. I suppose some people will be ok with this mode, as it enhances security and performance by only allowing programs available in the Microsoft Store. The vast majority of us however, will want to switch out of this mode ASAP. Fortunately switching modes is a very simple procedure. Here is the process:Go to Settings  > Update & Security  > Activation.In the Switch to Windows 10 Home section, select Go to the Store. There is also an "upgrade your edition of Windows" section on the screen during this step, do NOT click the "Go to the Store" link below that!On the Switch out of S mode page that appears in the Microsoft Store, select the Get button.Congratulations! Your new computer now has Microsoft windows 10 home, without the restrictions of S mode!Bottom line - this laptop is an absolute bargain! I hope you found this review helpful, if so, please kindly click the "helpful" button! Thank you!',

				"I bought this laptop for its weight and that's about the only thing positive I can say about it.The processing power is not very strong, so performance-wise, I was not impressed. But with the pricetag considered, I'm all right with this.However, the biggest thing for me is the OS- WINDOWS 10-IN S MODE.I had never heard of S Mode, and I didn't notice this when I bought the laptop.Apparently, S Mode is Microsoft's way of ensuring that you only use their apps and products by blocking you from downloading any outside apps. You have to get them all through their store. So, for example, were I to try to download Norton's anti-virus from Norton's official site, Microsoft's S Mode would tell me that I am unable. Any and all files outside of their store are blocked from being downloaded.In order to leave S Mode, you have to change it in the settings, but then you have to use a registration key for Windows 10 Home or Pro. So I shelled out another $130 just to get a fully functioning OS. Factor that price into this laptop price. THEN- after purchasing Windows 10 Home, I had to keep trying over the course of 4 days for the laptop to accept me switching out of S Mode because Microsoft was conveniently having server errors on their side and so my request could not be processed at this time. This is a common issue, at least from what I read among those discussing S Mode on Reddit forums. Multiple people report that Microsoft has server issues when you try to opt out of S Mode.Very very unhappy with this laptop for the sole reason that the OS is Windows 10 in S Mode. It was inconvenient and one of the most useless things I have ever seen pre-installed on a computer. Created a major and unnecessary headache for me.",

				"Really like this purchase. Core i3 1005G1, 128GB NVME SSD and 8GB RAM. It feels very snappy and responsive. The fingerprint logon is super fast and is one of the reasons I got it over the cheaper Acer. I got this for my wife as she only needs the most basic specs but I did not want to settle for anything less than a 10th generation Intl Core or 4000 series AMD Ryzen. I really would not change a thing about it for the price except that it should have had 250GB to 500GB of storage. The OEM is only paying $20 for the Hynix SSD they could have invested $10 more for a larger SSD. My laptop has 32GB of RAM but 8GB in this laptop does not feel slow at all. No bloatware from Asus at all. Office365 being pre-installed in three separate languages is unforgiveable by Microsoft. And why does it take 7 minutes to uninstall each language? Are they hoping you lose patience and give up the install so it can keep pestering you? Windows S Mode is annoying and disabling it is the only reason I had to help my wife set up this laptop. Although Windows S mode might be the reason it has so little bloatware installed.Pros: Ports! Wow it so nice to have 4 USB ports and one of them being USB-C; NVME SSD; 1920x1080 display with decent brightness. Core i3 super responsive. Light weight and slim. Thin bevels. Very premium feeling plastic case like it better than the aluminum HP Envy it replaced and is far lighter. Excellent keyboard and track pad.Cons: No RJ45 wired LAN. For the price it exceeds my exceptions in everything except storage. 128GB is on the small side. I would rather upgrade the the storage later than buy something else with a larger drive. LCD could use darker, blacks, but that is a picking at a small detail at this price point. The viewing angles are on the poorer side but I don't care about that and neither does my wife.Update 2020/10/15Was getting long stutters running Zoom Video Conferencing and Google Sheets in the FireFox browser. System resource meter showed Memory utilization at 70% and CPU at 50%. 70% memory usage istto much and it means it was hitting the SSD for pagefile swapping. I had a stick of 8GB DDR-4 2666 laying around so I replaced the 4GB DDR-4 3200 to upgrade it to a total of 12GB RAM. (See included photos) That did the trick. Memory utilization is now 50% for same workload.",

Like for example, when I saw the laptop for the first time, the screen was sooo much bigger than I anticipated! I love the feeling of the keys. Also, I'm sure you've notice there are a lot of reviews complaining about the screen quality. Ok. Here's the tea sis; the screen is awesome. I'm not seeing anything wrong with it. Those people must be computer experts but for me, there is nothing wrong with it. Also, a big criteria for me was that I could do some gaming. Dude. Literally this laptop is awesome for gaming.

				"To start, I believe this may be the first review I have ever left. My experience has been so negative that I feel compelled to share.In the beginning, the laptop seemed and worked great. We have a newborn in the house, though, so I was barely able to use it. When I did, I was impressed with its light weight, its overall design, and the processing speed. All were a great improvement over my older HP laptop.However, one day about 3 weeks after buying the laptop, the screen behaved oddly. It pixelated and froze. Once restarted, it operated properly, but obviously this was still an alarming development in a weeks old computer. I should have immediately sent in a return request to Amazon, but because of my odd Covid-related work schedule and our newborn, I just didn't react quickly enough. My BIG mistake.The next time I had a chance to use the laptop again, the screen conked out. To my dismay (and anger at myself), this was 2 days after the return window had closed. Now I was stuck. I tried restarting it, but each time the screen would start off fine, but then get 'flashy' (I'm not technically astute enough to describe its behavior any better), then it would go completely pixelated. Finally, it went irrecoverably black.Here's where it gets ugly. The ASUS online support is totally unavailable and misleading, referencing the coronavirus as a cause. There is no way to create an online RMA, as the website claims. Nor is their online tech and troubleshooting assistance available through chat, which again, the website claims. The clicks just circle you back around to homepage. The only way to get assistance is through a phone call. I called twice, and was on hold for 12 minutes before quitting, then 20 minutes before quitting.A curiosity- the voice over that is playing while you are on hold brags about how many awards they won in 2014. 2014 was 6 years ago! That is not a good sign. But I digress,I started to wonder if maybe they simply NEVER answered. \"Let's just ship out some bad PCs with no recourse for the customers\"-- sure, not a long-term solution, but they could do well for the quarter.I committed to waiting them out, and on the third try I was able to get hold of a customer service rep after 50 minutes on hold. He was fairly helpful, though I did not like how forcefully he tried to get me to troubleshoot the problem myself. The problem was so obviously a manufacturer's flaw and not something user related that I feel like a standup company should have just apologized and offered to next-day a replacement to someone in my situation. That was far from the case. I was given and RMA and label to ship it back. That was ~October 23rd. They estimate the computer will be fixed within 10 days of receiving it, 10 days! Thankfully, I am not in a desperate situation. I have access to my old computer and my work computer. Imagine someone who needed a computer for their livelihood or school. 10 days is an eternity! Especially when you add in the transit times. That's 2 plus weeks.Except it's even worse. I tracked the shipment, and it arrived at the repair site on the 28th of October. However, when you use the ASUS RMA status checker, they don't acknowledge receiving it until November 3rd. So if they're measuring their turnaround time on repairs, but doing so with manipulated  receipt date, the already terrible 10 days is meaningless. Anyway, they set an estimated completion date. That date came, and the FIELD disappeared from the ASUS RMA status checker. The field was gone, not just the date. Now, it has reappeared, of course with the date pushed out.For an expensive purchase, this seems like it should be illegal. They have lemon laws for car; I wish there were similar for computers.Again, I am in no hardship. I have access to computers if needed. I feel for anyone who buys an ASUS and needs it, and has something go wrong. What happens if I get it back and the same issue recurs, or another pops up? Another hour plus with customer service, and another month turnaround to get it fixed?Maybe it is a great computer, and I just got the one in the bunch that was botched. I can't say. I have had one ASUS computer, and that one ASUS computer was trash. So they are batting .000 for me.Maybe Amazon can pressure companies that sell big ticket items to have some basic standards of customer service? ASUS has none. Their customer service is appalling. My wife bought an HP a week before I bought my ASUS. She was jealous of the ASUS, preferring its appearance and ergonomics. That jealousy disappeared pretty quickly, though. She had a minor problem with her laptop, and a rep talked her through it in minutes.And here I am, typing this review on my old computer.",

				"Let's start with the hardware itself. I was worried the screen would be as terrible as some of these reviews indicate. In my opinion, the screen is just fine. It's probably not great in very bright sunlight, or for video or photo editing purposes. Otherwise, if you just want to do indoor office work, or browse the web, it's totally sufficient and not a reason to pass up this laptop. If you are already used to higher quality displays or have demanding display needs, stop being cheap and look to spend a bit more money.I like the feel and look of the keyboard but I don't like the layout so much. It's novel to include the keypad on a laptop of this size, but it's too close to the other keys. The result is that sometimes you hit the number pad instead of enter, or backspace. It's annoying but not a dealbreaker, and if you type a lot like I do, you'll probably find that you can develop a type of muscle/spacial-familiarity to where it becomes an infrequent issue very quickly.I bought this laptop to install linux on. It required a bit of wrangling with the BIOS to make that possible. Firstly, secure boot and some other settings need to be disabled in the BIOS. Next problem was, this machine does not seem to be capable of booting from the microSD card slot at all. I was able to boot off a USB-connected drive. Once I set the built-in storage interface mode to AHCI in the BIOS, I was able to complete my installation and everything works great. For the record I installed the \"elementaryOS\" distro.",

Because of the new chip, battery life is nuts on the 11in model, although for most use cases the power is overkill. But, that will just ensure the device remains usable for years to come. Perfect tablet, and I’d recommend it to everyone if the base model wasn’t so expensive.",

				"I'm giving this a three star rating because if you haven't had an iPad to compare it to, you'd probably find it a major upgrade from a generic $60 tablet. You might even find it an upgrade over a $100 tablet. But if you've owned the regular iPad, you're going to be sorely disappointed.(1)The screen is a lint magnet. You'll need to clean it every hour if you intend on long stretches of reading.(2) Plan to spend the rest of your life charging it. If you're a big reader, it's not functional for a 5 hour reading session. They claim the battery life is 13 hours, but I call bull on this. Six hours is a stretch. While it's possible I got a defective tablet, I doubt it. Videos especially drain it, about 20% every hour.(3) The picture quality. My God, the picture/video quality. I had the 2020 iPad 10.2-inch. So I was expecting a major upgrade over this. It wasn't. It's a downgrade. In fact, it's so questionable I believe Apple outright lied about the 4K video and/or pixels on the camera. Once again, it's possible I got a defective iPad Pro 11\", but I doubt it.Those are three major flaws that will make this my last iPad Pro. It's not an upgrade over the regular 10.2\" iPad. The top and bottom bezels are a little smaller and it's definitely thinner, but I enjoyed the picture quality on the regular iPad more. The thickness of the tablet seemed to give depth to the pictures. I read a lot of online comics, and those comics looked better on the regular iPad than they do the Pro, which was a shock.I've never had an iPad air. I skipped it and went straight to this one. I got the 11\" because I'm not very strong and believed the 12.9\" would be too laptop like and heavy. I already have a laptop, so I was going for portability. I do like the 11\"'s thinness, style, and look. It's beautiful, especially when it's in the Smart Folio.As for performance, picture, and video quality: The regular 2020 10.2\" iPad is just as good, and I'm not saying that because I have a vendetta against Apple (although I do resent them calling this a \"pro\" anything. Not even close). This tablet is just as good - and bad - as the regular iPad, and they've hiked the price up $400 for no reason. I don't care what they're calling the tech in this iPad. It actually boots up in about the same time as the regular iPad, and even if it didn't, I liked the picture on the regular iPad just as much.This is not worth the money or even close.",

				"This device is amazing. Sleek, fast with m1, screen is beautiful.All that Apple needs to do is to update iPadOS so that it has better:1) multitasking and windowing support;2) a file management app that actually has a format media and an unmount media function (as it stands you can’t currently unmount your external disk safely on iPadOS14.. which can lead to data loss, and you also can’t format a disk using the iPad);3) multi-monitor support that uses the full aspect ratio of the external display and can display in extended mode. As it stands, the current implementation on iPadOS is to display a mirrored image of the iPad’s screen onto an external monitor. There’s no ability on a system level to display a separate image on the external monitor (some apps have this function but it’s a per-app feature rather than a system wide feature). This defeats the whole point of using a monitor with the iPad in the first place. I don’t want the image to be mirrored.The second issue with multi monitor support is a more egregious limitation in my opinion.  That is, the iPad will not by default display an image on the external monitor in its native aspect ratio. Most monitors these days are 16x9 or 16x10, but the iPad will by default display its image in 4x3 mode, meaning there will be black bars to the sides of the image on the external monitor. This is egregious. The iPad only uses a portion of the external monitor instead of using the whole screen. The very same m1 chip inside the iPad Pro is also inside of various macs, and all of these m1 devices except the iPad can display an image to an external monitor in the monitor’s native aspect ratio.  So this is a limitation that Apple has chosen to allow to exist.  Apple really needs to fix this.But other than these quirks and limitations, the iPad Pro is a fabulous device. I love it.",

				'I see so many people on here who are technology "experts"  stating how its slow and it sucks and its awful and its build quality is awful.With due respect its build quality is in line with paying $150 bucks for a 10.1" tablet.  Yes its plastic, yes its screen is only 1900x1200, yes its Media Tek processor is not the top processor available today, yes it ONLY has 2GB of ram.  However your stupid if you feel like this is a letdown, after all most of this information can be found right on the page to purchase the tablet.Here is the deal with this tablet.- I bought it to watch and consume Prime video, Netflix video, (maybe someday put the google store on it for youtube (but even now i can go to youtube on the silk browser and it works perfectly fine)- I play light games, but its able to play what I play without problem.- I do not feel i need to baby this tablet because I only paid 180 bucks for it (64GB not 32) in fact i got two HD8\'s and this HD10 for me for less than my wife\'s IPAD.  So if they break it.. im not out 300 bucks-Being a network engineer this is my get away from computers without getting away.  I have zero productivity apps on it (which i like) I have zero communication apps on it (which I like), This tablet for me is a way to get away from life.  I have a phone for talking, and work, and teams, and slack.Dont kid yourself, this is not a high end tablet.  These one star reviews needs to take a better look at themselves and understand  you get what you pay for.  And for me, this absoutley works for what i need it to do.  And i dont feel like crap if i drop it and break it.why not five star.  Speakers are not great, again get what you pay for... which to me is not a big deal... i would of only taken a half a star off for them if I could.',

Couldn't this be optimized better?I'm now quite upset and decided to return it, for the poorly designed software that drains battery and my deleted review by amazon!",

				"9/22/20 - Tablet died yesterday. Still under warranty.NOV 16, 2019 - If I could, I'd drop this to 2.5 stars. Why? Because it lost all my collections today.NOV. 6, 2019 - I've now spent about a week with the new HD 10. In this cut, I've done some rearranging to, I hope, make the review more useful.Also, I want to say that I agree with other reviewers, like Cody Schiemann, who assert that it is unfair to compare a $200 tablet to, say, a $1k Apple iPad. That's absolutely true. I want to emphasize that I do notexpect Amazon to sell for $200 a device that matches both the hardware and software sophistication of an Apple iPad.  But Amazon is no longer a neophyte player in this market. The problems with its software have now existed for several generations and can't be justified on the basis of cost savings. These flaws are not product \"killers\", but $200 is $200, and buyers should know what they can and cannot expect for that money.NOV. 1, 2019 - I plan on a \"Third Cut\" in the next few days after I've had a chance to more carefully compare the 2017 and 2019 HD-10s (beyond the technical specs which are available from Amazon). Please check back if you're still trying to make a decision about this model.Oct. 31, 2019 - NOTE: If you read my \"First Cut\" written about 3 hours after I received the 2019 model on Oct. 30, 2019, I apologize - a bit. I wanted 3 things from the 2019 model: performance, stability, and a better way to handle my collections of applications and games (around 300 in 30 or so collections). The still brain-dead \"application collection\" software design simply infuriated me.I'm going to assume there are several different kinds of buyers for this Amazon tablet and will try to organize this review so that you can easily identify the sections that pertain to you:1. Newbie - have an Android smartphone or tablet but have never owned an Amazon tablet (or have never had any kind of \"smart\"  portable device).2. Current owner of a non-Amazon tablet.3. Current owner of one of Amazon's smaller tablets.3. Currently own the HDX or 2017 HD-10 and are trying to decide if this is an upgrade.4. Own only Apple devices. (If you fall into this category, I can pretty much guarantee that none of Amazon's current tablets will meet your standards.)Also: I bought the 64GB model without special offers in Black.BACKGROUND:I owned 5 Fire tablets: the original 7\", the 2012 8.9\", the 2013 7\" HDX and the 2014 8.5\" HDX and the Fire HD 10 (2017 model). As I discussed in my review of the 2017 Fire HD 10 (https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3GZTHJ4SWER0C/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01MYXPMVK), I bought it mainly out of desperation because the battery in my beloved HDX was on its last legs.HDX vs. HDThe 2019 HD-10 is still not an HDX, and I admit to being baffled by Amazon's decision-making. I understand its desire to concentrate on the low-end market, to see its devices as delivery mechanisms for its products. But the 8.5\" HDX was produced in 2014, 5 years ago. I don't work in the technology sector so I don't have any facts about production costs, but I find it hard to believe that Amazon couldn't produce an HDX quality tablet without busting the buyer's budget. Why not go back to the more comfortable 8.5\" form factor (saving materials) and increase the screen resolution back to the HDX's 2560 x 1600?MY HD-10 (2017) EXPERIENCESo why did I order the 2019 model? Well, just as I felt I had no choice in 2017, I felt I had no choice but to try the presumably improved 2019 model. During the past year, I've pretty much stopped using the 2017 Fire HD-10. It was too slow, too erratic, the software too clunky. Apps would constantly disappear from my collections, and even with the help of a spreadsheet I built, recreating them took 2-3 hours (depending on how badly Amazon had messed things up). Books would fail to download. When I finally got one downloaded and started reading, I'd often get kicked back to the Library screen. So, for most of the past year, I have been relying almost completely on a Samsung Galaxy S8+ smartphone. It's fast, I can switch quickly and reliably between apps, and it even has a split screen (although its usefulness on such a small device is questionable).Still some things work better on a larger platform: reading books and PDFs, watching videos. So, I took the plunge and ordered the 2019 model, not without a lot of fear that I would be wasting my money.First Impression: Major, huge disappointment. Yes, it seems to be faster than the 2017 model but the OS has barely changed at all and not noticeably for the better.PACKAGINGThe tablet comes in a very simple box for which I am grateful. For too many years, Amazon has shipped its electronic products in extremely attractive, often difficult-to-open boxes. They looked too nice to toss in the trash but were so designed that they were pretty much impossible to \"re-purpose\".HARDWAREIt's a $150 - $200 device. Don't expect iPAD quality. Does it matter to me? No. It looks and feels fine and I always put my tablets (and smartphone) in cases, so \"looks\" don't matter to me.SIZEI still prefer the 8.5\" form factor: it's large enough for videos and reading and small enough to fit comfortably easily into briefcases, bookbags, or larger purses. But this is definitely a matter of personal preference.CAMERASThese are identical to those in the 2017 model, and, as I argued in my review of the 2017 model, I don't much care about the fact that they are not \"top-of-the-line\". Smartphones these days are practically being sold on the basis of their cameras, and they are simply easier to use than a 10-inch tablet. (To control, look for 3 itsy bitsy dots on lower right of the camera screen.)AUDIOI'm not an audiophile. I listen mainly to the BBC and podcasts. When I do listen to music installed on the tablet, I use headphones or connect to a Bose Bluetooth speaker. From my perspective, this is more than adequate.VIDEOThese tablets are designed to deliver video. You'd have to pay a lot to do better than this HD-10.MICRO-SD CARDI've not installed a microSD card, so I can't evaluate its usefulness. I will say that owners of the 2017 HD-10 spent pretty much the first year (at which point I stopped checking) complaining about a wide range of problems with the SD card.ANDROID vs. AMAZON INTERFACEAndroid purists consider Samsung's \"skin\" to be \"unacceptable\" for reasons I don't understand. Having used Amazon tablets for years and the Samsung Galazy S8+ for about two years, I am agnostic about the interfaces.Samsung gives me a lot of flexibility, which I like. But there's something to be said for the major categories (For You, Home, Books, Games & Apps, Shop, Music, Audible, Newsstand, etc.) that adorn Amazon tablets. They are logical groupings, albeit with limited customization within the groupings.If you've never owned a smartphone or tablet, you should find the interface friendly and useful. If you own an Android smartphone or tablet, well, you may or may not like Amazon's interface. And if this will be your umpteenth Amazon tablet, the interface will be very familiar.SETUPMy DSL is 50Mbps so your experience may differ timewise. Also, I ordered it registered to my account and, as mentioned above, I'm a longtime owner so Amazon \"knows\" me.Startup was fast.It asked me to choose my language, \"registered account\", installed updates (a process that took only a second), greeted me, connected to my Wi-Fi.Then it gave me the option to \"restore\" from my Fire (apps and games, Fire settings, Wi-Fi, email, search history). It listed one of my earliest HD tablets (the 7-inch HDX) but gave the option to show others. It came up with my 8.5-inch HDX and my 2017 HD10 - which is the one I accepted (although I was a bit worried that it showed a backup date of Oct. 8, 2019).Note: I did check my 2017 model to make sure that everything looked OK, especially that all of my apps and games were in their assigned collections on the Home screen.Setup went through several stages very quickly: restoring, signing into the account, updating to the latest software, Fire settings, etc. Then, and this is where catastrophe struck, it started to download my apps. The screen went blank. I thought perhaps it had done a hard shutdown and would restart shortly. But after about 5 minutes, the screen was still blank.I pressed the Start button and got a message that I needed Wi-Fi which was rather odd since the Wi-Fi symbol was on and when I checked that setting it was, indeed, connected.Set up continued but showed an erratic downloading time, ranging from around 40 minutes to 5 minutes to various numbers in-between. Finally, it said \"restoring error\" and told me to contact Amazon service at www.amazon.com/devicesupport or select \"do not restore\".Well I definitely wanted a restore from the cloud and I figured device support would be essentially useless. (Amazon had great customer service for its tablets during the first 4 or 5 years but, well, not so much anymore.)So, I decided to turn the tablet off, turn it back on and hope for the best.MOVING FROM ONE FIRE TO ANOTHERAmazon has never handled tablet synching well. I've spent way too much time with each new tablet bringing it \"up-do-date\". This was, however, my very worst experience.  None of my application collections were downloaded. Neither my Silk history nor bookmarks came through. All that showed up on the Home screen were Amazon apps.I treated the lack of application/game collections as an opportunity to discover if Amazon had finally updated its software. No such luck. The only way to create collections and add to them is by dragging and dropping, and it's an infuriating process due to a user interface whose creator should be sent to Purgatory. I had to download each app from the Games & Apps Library, then drag and drop to create the collections. You can't open a collection, expect a link to applications where you can click and add multiple collections. Not only has this functionality existed in the Books Library for years, but I'm pretty sure it exists on even the cheapest Android smartphone. Since I'm sure that every programmer who works for Amazon owns a smartphone of one kind or another, it's not as if I'm asking the company to invent a new technology.It took me close to 3 hours to recreate my collections (using the spreadsheet I built more than a year ago to deal with the 2017 model's erratic destruction of my collections). Beyond infuriating, especially since collection management was one of my main reasons for wanting a new tablet.(If you don't own hundreds of apps/games sorted into multiple collections, this probably won't be a problem for you. But for me it is a major disappointment.)WORSE: As of Nov. 16, 2019 all my collections are lost. Back to square one. Unacceptable.Games: a warning. If you play games like Candy Crush that allow you to create cloud accounts, your progress will, of course, transfer to the new tablet. However, King stores all the power-ups (bought or won) on the local device and those do not get transferred. This isn't an Amazon issue. Just King's way of trying to get more money from you. (I suspect this is true of other game developers as well.)SETTINGSGetting to the settings is not intuitive. There's no icon at the top of the Home screen. You must pull down, kind of \"hard\", to reach the settings icon. I have no idea what possessed Amazon to make this change to the UI.Amazon has made a number of esthetic changes to the settings, and seems to be offering more control over privacy and security.I was rather upset to discover that there was no longer an \"allow application installations from unknown sources\" generic option.  Instead, Amazon listed several apps, including Silk, with the option to accept (the default being not to) application installation from those sources.  Using Silk, I downloaded a 3rd party market application (to download apps not in Amazon's store). That went fine. Then from that marketplace I downloaded another application. At this point, Amazon asked if I wanted to accept application downloads from that source. I said yes.  In short, instead of a generic \"OK, you can do this\", Amazon is requiring that you specifically authorize any application that wants to download something. This is smart.PERFORMANCE & STABILITYThe 2019 HD-10 is the fastest tablet available from Amazon. It is also way more stable (so far) than my 2017 HD-10. None of my collections have disappeared. I've been able to move from one application to another (reading a book, surfing the web, checking Twitter or email) quickly and easily. Instead of using Twitter's built-in browser (as I've done for years because it was faster than using Silk), I made Silk the Twitter browser and noticed absolutely no difference in performance.The one quirk: the screen periodically \"blinks out\". I've changed the display timeout to 30 minutes, but that hasn't fixed the problem. When it occurs, I must press the Start button. I haven't yet been able to figure out when/why this is happening.GAME/APP STORES: APPLE, AMAZON, GOOGLEI honestly don't care about the relative number of games or apps available in each of these stores. 10,000? 20,000? Really, who would want to look through all of them? I own around 300 and, to be perfectly honest, got most of them with my first few generations of Fire tablets when Amazon was offering a free app every day.It should be obvious, but I will say it: you cannot install apps/games from Apple.As for the Amazon and Google stores: yes, Google has more apps/games. If you already own an Android smartphone or tablet, you're likely to find that some of the apps/games you use are not available from Amazon.What to do?Well, first of all, Amazon's own apps (Kindle, Audible, Alexa, etc.) are available in both stores (based on my smartphone experience). BUT, whether you are using an Android smartphone or an Amazon tablet, they may not play well together. Those of us who installed the Google Play Store on the 2017 HD-10 quickly ran into a problem with the Kindle app. The one from the Google Play Store didn't remember anything: it kept greeting us as if we were just starting out. The only \"fix\" was to turn off automatic updating in the Google Play Store and avoid updating Amazon apps from that store. On my Galaxy S8+, I've also run into intermittent problems with Amazon apps (especially the Kindle) downloaded from Google's store vs. from Amazon's.In short, with respect to the Amazon apps, be very careful to only download/update them from the Amazon store. I suppose this is the price we must pay for competition, but it is annoying and rather ridiculous since, I assume, Amazon is responsible for the Amazon apps in Google's Play Store.NON-AMAZON APPSThere are basically two ways to download apps that are not available in the Amazon app store. You can download the .apk files from several different sources (Google it) or you can install the Google Play Store.I've not tried the latter yet in part because I suspect some of my problems with the 2017 HD-10 may have been related to installing the Google Play Store since it is not a single app but a complete sub-system.OTOH, if an application or game you use depends on Google's play services, you pretty much have only two choices: install the Play Store or resign yourself to depending on your Android smartphone for those applications and games.I wrote about the pros and cons on December 10, 2017 in Amazon's digital and device forum. Specifics may have changed, but I think it still describes the basic issues fairly well. Title: Sideloading Apps and the Google Play Store: Should You or Shouldn't You? (https://www.amazonforum.com/forums/devices/fire-tablets/466696-sideloading-apps-and-the-google-play-store-should)Note: if you downloaded apps or games from non-Amazon sources to an existing Amazon table, you must download them again. They do not get backed up.SILK - AMAZON'S BROWSERAmazon's first tablet (2011) was panned by almost every techie and possibly nothing got dinged more than Silk. Yes, it was Amazon's first browser, but it wasn't as if web browsers were new in 2011. Silk has grown up and is an acceptable browser if you don't want to download Chrome or Firefox.  BUT, you can't sync Silk across tablets. Think about that for a moment. It is Amazon's own browser, designed solely for use in its tablets. Amazon provides cloud services around the world. You can install Chrome or Firefox on your desktop, your laptop, your smartphone and even on an Amazon tablet and sync your bookmarks and history. But you cannot do this with Silk.DOCUMENTSI won't go into the entire sordid history around Amazon's \"docs\", how it dumped non-Amazon ebooks into docs rather than the Books library, for example. What I will say is that you should plan on backing up to a source you control any documents you create or edit on your tablet because they won't show up on the next tablet you buy. And, believe me, finding them on your old tablet so you can transfer them to your new tablet is .... very annoying and time-consuming.NON-AMAZON E-BOOKSAmazon doesn't want you to get e-books from other sources. It doesn't even want you to get Kindle e-books from other sources.  Several years ago, it created a proprietary format so that programs such as Calibre (an ebook management system) couldn't even index them.So, what to do? If you use \"send-to-kindle\", well, don't open up the Files folder and look for them. They won't be there. You must use the Amazon \"Doc\" app (long since banished from the top row to a tiny little icon).What about other kinds of e-books?  I've gotten books from several different sources, all of which have informed me that their books are not compatible with Amazon tablets (even if they are, theoretically, \"). So I have installed the Bluefire Reader, BookFunnel and Moon+ Reader. But of course the books I downloaded to those apps didn't get backed up by Amazon. So now I must figure out where they are stored on my old Fire, and how and if I can get them on to my new Fire.NON-AMAZON MUSIC, PHOTOS AND VIDEOSGeneric warning: if you transfer non-Amazon music, photos or videos to your Amazon tablet, don't expect them to be there if your tablet dies, or breaks or you get a new one. For a while, Amazon let us back up all our MP3 files to the Cloud. No more. Currently, Amazon Prime customers can upload for free all their photos. Don't count on this lasting forever.BACKUP AND RESTOREThis has always been something of a bad joke since the Backup only backs up Amazon products.  Amazon used to do it nightly. There was also a manual option you could run whenever you wanted to. Now it runs weekly. No manual option.SUMMARYIf you've never owned an Android tablet and Amazon is your \"go-to\", want something on the larger size for reading and watching videos, you will probably like this tablet.If you already own one of the smaller Amazon tablets and like it but would like to move up to a larger form-factor, again, I think you will probably like this one (assuming that Amazon is actually able to recreate your environment on the new model successfully).If either of the above is true, or if you're thinking of switching from some other company's tablet, please pay attention to some of the issues I've addressed above. They may be totally irrelevant for you, but you should think about them.If you already own the 2017 HD-10, I'm not sure how to advise you. Yes, this tablet is, for me, faster and you may not have the setup problems I've had, but if you were hoping for some major upgrade, well, this isn't it.HDX owners: we're still out in the cold.Just remember: for Amazon, these are delivery devices for its products. Go outside that environment and, well, you may run into problems.",

Plus with the Anker Type C PD charger, I've been able to charge this tablet at 16 watts! Fast charging, type c, faster wifi, faster processor, and etc... this tablet is a steal at 149 dollars!",

				'We offer an app to thousands of restaurants throughout the world. We have a robust QA department that does regression and performance testing in a very scientific manner. We ordered 2 of these devices in order to evaluate performance improvements in order to decide if this new gen 9 model would be a budget device that we could recommend to customers. We have large number of kindle devices on-hand and tested it thoroughly against the previous generation of the Fire HD 10 (gen 8). In our tests we held  all other variables constant (close other applications, use the exact same amazon account for sign in, etc.). We hoped to see something similar to the 30% faster performance advertised. Unfortunately, the newer generation devices performed consistently slower than the previous generation, despite the new "faster" processor. We can only speculate why this is the case. Our best conjecture is that the OS upgrade might be heavier or not playing nice with the new hardware? Either way, this is a significant performance regression over the previous model.',

If you're already used to the way smartphones function, this will be a piece of cake!I've been playing with it since I opened the box and have discovered the sound quality, image quality and video playback to be superior to any other tablet I've used. Im pleased with the storage capacity and battery life as well.Downloading apps are easy too, through Amazon Appstore. Ive already been to all of my social media sites with it.It' s wonderful and powerful, in every way! This will be the tablet I use, exclusively,  from now on with future upgrades.I'm an avid reader and I love the way Kindle books view on the Fire, which is the main reason I bought it!Because of this tablet, I will continue my Amazon Prime membership!",

				'I had an 8 .9 (which was a wonderful tablet for its day).  Then I got a 7" for my Mom.  Not so great, too small.  I ordered an 8" (OK, but nothing special) , and then a 7th gen 10", which is nice.  My Mom is getting frustrated with the lack of newer games for her old 7" , so I am giving her the newer 8" so she can load more card games.I play a lot of role-playing games and also read a lot, so 10" tablets are a must for me.  This 9th Gen is quite similar to my 7th Gen.  It virtually set up itself based on my previous settings on my older tablet.  (UPDATE 10/31:  Although the Silk browser bookmarks and favorites did sync, books and apps did not sync.  I\'m hoping that this issue will be corrected by Amazon soon.)  (UPDATE 11/2:  A hard shutdown and reboot has resolved the above issues).  The drop down options are slightly different.  If you have a 7" or an 8" Kindle, you will probably be impressed with this tablet\'s capabilities.  If, like myself, you have an older 10,  the differences won\'t be immediately apparent.  I\'m assuming that the promised increased speeds will be noticeable when I get a chance to stream video or play my games.Those of us who utilize Amazon products and services enjoy our Fire tablets.  Those who don\'t would probably prefer other brands of tablets, because Amazon doesn\'t make it easy to access content that isn\'t Amazon.',

In my review of yesterday (which is gone), I complained that Location Services would not kick in and Tech Support could not assist.  I primarily wanted the tablet to stream TV -- in my case Hulu.  Hulu would not stream due to lack of location and weather had me in Seattle when I am in Alabama.  I gave a One Star review and was deliberating what to do -- perhaps send back.  This post is for (hopefully) the assistance of others.  I took my tablet to my gym (which has guest WiFi) and logged in to WiFi there.  Location Services kicked in.  Hulu worked.  I returned home and it now works on my home network.  Not a very high tech or explainable solution -- but a resolution.

				" What is this flickering on the tablet? See video and picture. Usually happens when I connect and app to Facebook. Great tablet, I love it otherwise, but not sure what’s going on with this flickeringUPDATE#1-Amazon tech support Rachel, called me after seeing my review and tried to help me. She took control of my tablet to view the problem and did trouble shooting. Amazon is going to send me a new tablet as I am the only one with this issue. I really enjoy the new fire 10! It’s faster than the 7th gen, and worth every penny! Thanks Amazon!UPDATE 2: David R from device retrieval is terrible and does not care for Amazon customers. He sent me a label to return the defective device and stated I would get a $30 credit by returning it in 48 hours which I did. But his label was missing when I tried to print so I called Amazon and was told by Lucien B. That David made a mistake and did not send me a proper label and Lucien B from amazon sent me another. I returned the device and because David’s label was not working I will not get a credit as promised. David R would not let me speak to a manager he stated he was in the highest position at Amazon and there was no one higher than him I could speak to. Plus the replacement tablet is also flickering when you connect games to Facebook!FINAL UPDATE: Rachel from tech support has taken care of all the above and sent reassuring communication to me. She has gone above and beyond to take care of my issues and keep an Amazon customer satisfied and happy. She really cares about Amazon customers! Don’t lose this employee Amazon or it would be your loss! Thanks Rachel! Regarding the tablet, the battery lasts super long, I can go 2 days without charging it! Very responsive and I love it more than any of the other fires I own-7 inch, 8 inch, and previous version 10 inch.",

				"This very good all-in-one computer would be a great choice for an instant videoconferencing computer during a quarantine. \n\nPROS\n-Very simple setup and go. Just plug in the power cable, mouse, and keyboard. Then connect to wifi or ethernet and you on your way. \n-Very compact form factor. It takes up no more depth space than a typical monitor.The computer is neatly located on the back of the monitor and you wouldn't even know it's there.  \n-Monitor bezels are very thin creating a sleek minimalist appearance. \n-Resolution is 1920x1080 which is fine for a monitor this size. \n-Can run a 2nd monitor via HDMI so you can run a 2 monitor setup. I hooked mine up to a 4k monitor and it works well. \n-Computer specs are excellent with a fast NVMe ssd. The 8gb of RAM is plenty for most applications.-Integrated card reader and optical drive add flexibility and convenience. \n-Integrated webcam is especially useful for video conferencing during pandemics. There is a small slider at the top that physically closes the camera for privacy. \n\nCONS\n-Stand only tilts. No height or swivel. \n-No VESA mounting option. \n-There is a power brick which adds clutter. Since one of the main reasons to get an AIO is to decrease clutter, the power brick is disappointing.  \n\nOTHER\n-McAfee virus protect is preinstalled and within a day it was showing pop-ups on the desktop. Unless you really want this app, uninstall it right away. There were no other 3rd party preloaded apps which is nice. \n-Speakers sound fine but I wish they pointed outwards toward you instead of downward. \n-4 USB ports which may or may not be enough although you can always add a USB hub. No USB-C which is slightly disappointing since this is 2020.\n-Included wired keyboard is fine but the wired mouse is cheap. I'm glad they went cheap on these accessories because many people will just add on a wireless set anyway. \n\nOVERALL\nThis is an impressive all-in-one (AIO) computer with a form factor so sleek, you wouldn't even know a computer is hidden behind the monitor. I've built over 10 computers in my life including the small form factor NUC's and can say that the specs on this Lenovo are a tremendous value at under 600 dollars. \n\nLike any AIO computer, you can't upgrade the monitor and you can't expect to upgrade the SSD or RAM. Fortunately, this Lenovo minimizes those issues by allowing you to run a 2nd monitor (even 4k) and using a blazing 256gb NVMe drive which would work excellent as a boot drive for a long time. You can always add an external USB hard drive if you need more storage.",

				"As someone who has always used desktops, with a laptop as a rare on the go tool, the idea of switching over to an all in one computer was a bit strange to me. I have to say the All in One aspect of the Idea Center is definitely a huge plus if you like a quiet office and a minimalist feel.\n\nThe Idea Center arrives fully assembled with a serviceable mouse and keyboard. All you have to do is plug it in and plug the mouse and keyboard into the back and it is up and running! The computer has a disc drive that pops out sideways from the back of the monitor. It is a bit fiddly getting a disc in but it works fine.\n\nI've included a picture of all the ports on the machine. On the back you have the ethernet and power port, one HDMI port, one SS USB and 2 USB 2.0 ports. There is another SS USB on the side along with a SD card reader and audio jack. The SD card reader will read SD, SDXC and SDHC.\n\nHonestly though, the best idea would be to get a usb port expander if you tend to need to plug and unplug things a lot. Inserting the usb into the side usb port is not very convenient and it is very close to the back of the monitor. For my purposes the two ports for the peripherals in the back and the one for a transfer cable for my phone are just enough.\n\nThe camera is really good for zoom calls and comes with a built in slider so that you can cover it after use. When covered you see a red dot behind the lens. The built in speakers are more than adequate and the slim bezel on the monitor gives you an unexpectedly large screen to work on.\n\nAs to set up, I was very pleasantly surprised and very impressed with the IdeaCenter very quickly. My old desktop was fried by a power surge and I had been using an old laptop and then my son's discarded gaming computer for a while. The thought of setting up another computer and installing everything was exhausting to even think of. Lenovo seems to have thought of this exact scenario because the first thing the computer offered to do was import all my files from my current computer wirelessly! All I needed to do was install the Lenovo Migration App onto my old computer. (I am not sure how this would work if both computers were not running windows 10 but mine were and the process was seamless) The new computer gave me a pin which I entered into the old one and it pulled all the files over the wifi connection! It is the little things in life but having this take about 2 minutes to do was surprisingly nice.\n\nThe other nice touch is the Your Phone Companion App which allows you to get your notifications from your phone (texts, alerts, etc) directly on your computer. This can be really helpful if you tend to work with your headphones on and miss texts and calls. The computer also found my wireless printer, installed the drivers and software and connected without a hitch. I literally had all the important things for my home office set up in under 10 minutes.\n\nI've been using the Idea Center for about a week now and have to say I am really very happy with it. I don't miss the noisy fans and the lack of leg space under my desk. The computer is utterly silent and comes on quickly and performs very well. Bluetooth with my headset works well and I haven't encountered any issues to speak of. It does only have 8G of RAM so animating, programming or working on big spreadsheets might cause a hiccup. I don't really need a very powerful computer so it fits my needs well.\n\nFrom someone who is used to the days where setting up your tower took hours and getting your computer to fit your likes and dislikes could take days, this is really a wonderful little machine.",

				"I owned this for approximately 45 days when both the camera and the microphone stopped working. I went through Lenovo's troubleshooting steps to attempt to resolve it as well as my own steps (I have a degree in Electrical Engineering and have built multiple systems) to no avail. Tried calling their tech support and was told that I \"didn't qualify\" for phone support. I chatted with their bot that stepped through troubleshooting steps and finally stated that I needed to open a ticket, which I did. I finally reached out to Amazon Support and they were better; they got Lenovo on the phone with me. Lenovo told me there were no technicians available, create a ticket (already done) and someone will call me back in 24 hours. It's now been 5 days and I still haven't heard from Lenovo.

Do NOT buy a Lenovo product.\n\nUpdate: I contacted Lenovo via Facebook and they remotely connected w/my computer, determined (eventually) that it was hardware failure and agreed to send out a representative to repair my machine. 4 days ago, they emailed me and said that they are waiting on parts.

				"This is a nice, powerful computer that ships with everything you need to get started. Setup was simple and straightforward: just plug everything in and turn it on. I timed 23 minutes from opening the box to starting a video call with a friend. I appreciated the fact that the computer came with a wired keyboard and mouse, but agree with other reviewers that wireless would have helped the aesthetic.\n\nFeatures:\nThe display is not a touchscreen. A computer like this should really have a touchscreen in my opinion. The brightness is not perfectly even: the edges of the screen are slightly darker than the rest of the screen. Also, the displaying part of the screen does not extend all the way to the plastic bezel, but goes black about 3/16\" short of it (the product images are inaccurate in this regard). According to my measurements, the display surface is only 85% of the total front surface, not 90% as the description says. This is still higher than most other displays I've used.\n\nThe screen only tilts up and down; it does not rotate on the other two axes (side-to-side, and spinning clockwise), and it does not have adjustable height.\n\nThe webcam aims a bit too high; when I tilt the screen comfortably, my face is centered about 1/3 of the way from the bottom of the video frame. There is no way to adjust the camera without tilting the screen, so during video calls I have to tilt the screen a bit lower than I would like. The privacy cover is pretty cool though. When it's closed, there's a little red circle visible. Unfortunately, the circle is off-center if you slide the cover over all the way. This does not negatively affect functionality, however.\n\nThe optical drive is DVD, not Blu-ray, which is a bit disappointing. I thought about connecting a Blu-ray player to the HDMI port, but the port is for output only, not input, so that's not an option.\n\nThe SSD is blazing fast, but only holds 256 GB. After Windows is installed, it's even less. With a few basic programs installed, I have only 185 GB of space left. If you intend to use this computer to store games, videos, or photos, you'll probably need additional storage space. As another reviewer also pointed out, there's a way to add another 256 GB SSD; the instructions for replacing an M.2 SSD are in the Hardware Manual on the website. There is also a slot for a 1 TB HDD. Lenovo does not seem to be advertising either of these options, and I haven't tried either, so I can't guarantee that they'll work. The drives are also a bit pricey. If you're not concerned about speed, an external hard drive may be a better option.\n\nThe wire organizing clip is a bit of a pain to get into place. You have to line it up just right with little tiny grooves in the metal stand.\n\nSpeed:\nWith a 4-core AMD processor and 8 GB of RAM, this is powerful enough for my needs. I downloaded a VM hypervisor and was able to smoothly run the Ubuntu operating system from within the Windows operating system. In other words, I emulated a second (virtual) computer completely within Windows 10, and the computer handled it just fine.\n\nPortability:\nBefore I got the computer, I wondered whether I could travel with the computer if the stand was removed. The computer comes with the stand already securely attached; removing the stand is possible, but you need to remove a plastic cover and unscrew a few screws. Even without the stand, the computer doesn't fit in a standard suitcase. It's not a particularly easy process. I don't know if you had the same idea I had, but I don't think this computer was designed to be portable.\n\nOverall:\nI'm satisfied with the speed and functionality of this computer, but it isn't as good in other respects as I would like. The above-center webcam, the fact that the optical drive is only DVD, the tiny 256 GB storage space, and the uneven lighting on the screen make this computer less than perfect. But if you don't need anything fancy, and you don't mind a couple of minor shortcomings, it's a decent buy.",

				"I made a mistake. The original Earpods that came with my Apple iPhone 6 Plus started cutting out. I decided for the cheaper option of the Amazon headphones rather than a slightly more expensive Earpod replacement. I now regret that decision.\n\nThe Amazon headphones are not even CLOSE to the same comfort, fit, quality as the Apple Earpods. No matter how I tried, I just couldn't fit the Amazon headphones in my ear. I tried the different sizes and twisted. They would stay in a few minutes and then pop out. It was a disaster for exercising.\n\nI found the Amazon headphones very uncomfortable. They didn't just sit in the ears like the Apple Earpods. They had to be squeezed inside the ear canal. Obviously Apple (and all manufactures) have patents on their designs that Amazon cannot copy. So, Amazon must have been very limited in their choice of design. It's just NOT good. And it plugged the ears so much that I heard my breathing and heartbeat. Once I put them in, I couldn't wait to get them back out.\n\nThe sound quality is garbage. It's not even CLOSE to the quality of the Apple Earpods. The sound is loud, but very harsh and tinny. I guess if I never had any headphones before and used the Amazon headphones, I would probably just accept it because I had nothing to compare it to. However, I had the Apple Earpods, so I could make a direct comparison. It's not even close. So, I went ahead and ordered another Apple Earpods - which is only about $5 more. I should have done that initially. I cannot recommend the Amazon headphones.",

				"The charts attached show the analysis with the noise canceling on (on the left / green box) and off (on the right / blue box).\n\nThese are OK for the money. I'm sure there are other headphones available for around $34 that perform better, and certainly some that perform worse. The package however boasts \"95% ambient noise reduction\" which is not true. Here in my office where the only noise is from the fan on my computer it's not even that. I'd like to say something on the order of 40%.\n\nI graphed the results in Audacity using a mic in a foam filled box to record differences in ambient noise. I placed 1\" holes in the sides of the box where the drivers for the Sony headphones would normally find an aural cavity. This is crude I understand, but it was sufficient for my ends to test these. If you would like a more accurate test feel free to get a human skull and address this matter yourself.\n\nThe results show that with Noise Canceling on there is a 3dB reduction on sounds below 86 Hz (yellow), and a similar reduction at the top end around 3000-3800Hz where another 3dB reduction is noticed (red). Where these appear to shine is in the mid range between 1000-2800hZ where the reduction of ambient noise is more linear keeping the noises between 46-55dB while on, and 53-62dB while off (orange).",

				"If you're looking for an inexpensive noise reducing (note, I did not say cancelling) headset for use on an airplane, the Sony MDRX110NC is a really solid buy. If you are looking for a headset that truly cancels all noise, you are going to be disappointed with this purchase.\n\nPros:\n-They work well at reducing airplane engine noise (the reason I bought them.)\n-Compact due to their folding design.\n-On ear design, which work very well if you wear glasses.\n-Price, price, price.\n\nCons:\n-Do not have the best sound, so if you're looking for Bose like quality, stop here.\n-I found the cord length a tad short, but certainly wasn't a deal breaker.\n\nIn order for these to do their job, you simply must turn the switch on, without them they are no better (perhaps even worse) than the free earbuds that come with any smartphone. Both my wife and I have used the one set we own on business trips. Having just booked a trip to Europe, I just bought a second set so that we will both have them for the long flight.\n\nFor the price, these headphones are good enough, and if anything were to happen to them, I would't feel nearly as bad as I would if I had paid $300-400 for top of the line headphones.",

From there is just awesome and awesomeness. Is interesting to find the "push" button to open and put inside the power battery, because have a nice design on it. When I connect them to my iPhone and play the first song (How Gee / Black Machine) I was a little bit disappointed with the sound. And then I remember the battery inside, so I turn on the power sound and I was transported to another level of sound. Well done Sony! After that is just happiness. I highly recommend this product and I will just add that the noise canceling works perfectly. Nobody can hear my songs and I\'m not feeling any sound from outside.\nAgain, good job guys.',

				"These may not be the best performance noise cancelling headphones, but they are outstanding value. I bought them for my daughter first, and my wife and I kept stealing them when she fell asleep on the plane. They are helpful even if you're not listening to anything - just to diminish the airplane roar on long flights. Next I bought myself a pair and my wife was stealing mine. I even started using them at home when I was working on the computer and wife/kid were watching TV. Then I got some for my wife, and finally my mother. Now nobody steals each other's headphones. My mother really appreciated hers on a long Norway flight. Imagine the cost of all these headphones if we were buying the $200+ a pair headphones... You can wear these for several hours without getting uncomfortable, they make the quietest movie easily hear-able, and they diminish the airplane roar by about 50%, which is a huge benefit. I have worn them, and the Bose do perform noticeably better, but it's not worth the money if you have to buy them for a whole family.",

				"A couple of notes if you're considering these headphones:\n\n- The noise-canceling is just okay ... probably what you'd expect from an inexpensive set of headphones.\n- The sound quality is excellent with the noise-cancelling turned on. You really can't listen to anything with it turned off ... the sound quality is very low\n- On a train, the noise canceling blocks out some of the engine rumble, but not really much of the jarring noises such as the clackity clack of the wheels or people yapping. The box says \"95% ambient noise reduction*\" and then some long disclaimers about what that means. To me it's kind of like \"outside noise is reduced maybe 50%\"\n- It helps to turn the volume up a little ... I don't notice people around me chit-chatting as much\n- In the office, the noise reduction seems better. Some of the office noise is cancelled, and people talking isn't as noticeable.\n- These headphones are comfortable to wear, and fold up easily to fit in a bag or (big) purse\n- If it matters to you, no one can hear what you're listening to. I don't like to annoy people with my music (especially on the train) so I checked with a couple of people and they couldn't hear a thing.\n\nThese won't surround you in silent bliss like the expensive headphones.

Recently ordered replacement foam pads from Sony Customer Service that contracts with a company named Encompass.

Bought these with the expectation that they would do a decent job of filtering out background noise, and because I've always appreciated the Sony brand when it comes to delivering or listening to music.\n\nThese exceeded my expectations. This is my first pair of noise cancelling headphones though, so keep that in mind. It's an eerie thing to have an air conditioner or fan running nearby just cease to exist when you hit the switch on the back. And while it's true it doesn't block out people speaking the same way, once I have music pumping through my headphones it doesn't seem to matter - I can see folks are talking but I can't really hear them. I'm not into making my ears bleed volume-wise either.\n\nBass is a bit heavy handed on this when most of my gear amps up the bass already, but I got used to that pretty quick.\n\nIn short, they are magic and I cherish them.

				"So the price was right. Hard to complain when it's $2 a shirt. As it turns out, that's about what they're worth. First thing I noticed was that they're short and wide. They're not tapered as suggested in the description and pictures. It's a one-size-fits-all design. That can really be seen in the neck opening. For the Large size that I got, it's a whopping 11.5 inches in diameter. That means for normal men, it will sit low, causing a lot of neck and back to be exposed, and also, the neckline will be really loose. For comparison, my Jockey t-shirts are 8.5 to 10 inches, and a couple that I got at Target (Merona) are 9 inches. To make matters worse, after one wash, the material along the neckline curled badly. An oversized neck opening with a curled rim is NOT a good look. The shirts are simply unwearable in public. So all 6 immediately go into the rag drawer and I'll use them for painting or other messy jobs where it's okay if the shirt gets ruined. No idea why these shirts are getting good reviews.",

				"I love this dress. I feel that it is a generous Medium in size. If you are the girl that cant decide on the medium or the large, then this maybe your dress. I usually have problems with fit in the chest 37DD (36 too tight 38 too big) I am sure ladies with similar size understand this. I was equally concerned because it has a zipper in the back and that usually is the kiss of death. This dress didn't let me down. I also think if you aren't as well endowed that it wont look big up top. The V-neck isn't too deep but enough to wear most any necklace. The sleeves are great with the bell and complete the look and the length is perfect. Not too long (I am 5.5) hits above the knee, but I can move freely without fear of exposing too much like some dresses. Im 49 and find that some I feel age inappropriate, however I am too young for other styles. I did order both the medium and the large for all of these reasons and the medium fit like a glove, so will return the large. Gotta love Prime and Kohls returns!",

				"This dress is adorable. It is fairly short. I’m 5 feet tall and it comes above my knee. I ordered up a size (got a medium) because I wanted something a little loose and flowy... should have gotten a large. I’m 5 feet tall 125 pounds and pretty curvy. It fits perfectly now but no extra room as I had wanted. I’ll have to decide whether to keep it or Exchange for large. I have to say it’s very cute, although sheer.\nUPDATE: I ordered a large to see if it would give me the boxier look I wanted. It does not, it just looks too big so I am returning it. Here’s the kicker though, it is lined! The last one I ordered is not lined, and if you’ll notice above I even said it was sheer! I thought about ordering a third time In medium in hopes of getting a lined one, but who knows what I’ll get next time. I’ve decided to just get a slip in black. Still an adorable dress for the price. Adding another update: just ordered my third one of these! Originally got black, then the royal blue and now just got the blush bamboo leaf print for a summer wedding. Love theses dresses. And further to the above review, this one is lined!",

				"I loved this jacket when I saw it on \"Making the Cut,\" but the IRL version is disappointing and puzzling. Worn with the stitched stripes around the bottom, it fits my 5'10\" bod fine. But flip it to wear the stitching down the front and you end up with a flipped-up \"tail\" of fabric curved up over your bottom. There's no way to flatten this by buttoning it or pulling it forward. You'll have a denim arch over your rear end.\n\nThere's LOTS of denim fabric in this garment and since it's unlined, the pale underside faces out on the flap-front collar. Also the one place Levi's skimped on the fabric is the sleeves, which are not full-length and are very tight (especially when you flip it up to the tail-arching side).\n\nNot sure about keeping this. I like it one way, even with the unlined bit showing. But they really needed to figure out that back part in the construction.\n\nI ordered a L-XL and it covers my back end, but the sleeves are pretty skimpy. I don't think designer Gary Graham would've wanted it that way.\n\nCaveat emptor.",

				"OK. I love Making the Cut and Gary Graham is by far my favorite designer on the show. When I saw this design won, I literally ran to my phone to order one. I saw the weird tail on the back in the photos but decided to try it.\n\nI'm 5'11\" and usually wear a US ladies medium, 10 or 12 and I got a S/M. It's a little roomy but I think that's how it's supposed to fit.\n\nPros:\n\nI love that there are so many different ways to wear this. I'll post some photos of the initial ways I found.\n\nThe denim is soft and drapey but not thin.\n\nIt's very unique.\n\nI like that it supports the idea of genderless dressing.\n\nCons:\n\nFor a $200 jacket from Levi's, I expected something really top quality. It feels middle of the road and there are no \"extras.\" The fabric is not premium, and if you wear the front hanging open, the backside is a light color which cheapens the look a bit.\n\nThe 'tail\" is insane. See the other reviews about this too. I'm a home sewer and if I keep this jacket, I'll install a discreet snap so I can fold the collar back and up inside the jacket which will help with this a lot. I didn't notice this tail on Gary's original jacket and I can't believe Levi's couldn't sort out this design detail. For a $200 jacket I shouldn't have to alter it in this kind of way!\n\nI don't know if I'll keep this, but since it's now totally sold out maybe I will... I like the way it fits and it's very cool, the tail thing is just bizarre though. If Levi's makes more of these they need to sort that detail out, make it fold in, or make that part from something way more drapey.",

				"Confession: Even though I LOVED this jacket watching it walk down the runway, and I wanted to love it on me, I bought it fully expecting to return it. At 5'4\" (almost) and a medium-small build, I thought even the S/M would swallow me up, with the wonderfully weird angles getting lost & being utterly unflattering. But...\nReturn it? NO WAY!!!! OMG I LOVE IT!\nAs frugal a shopper as I am, I think that $200 is a bargain for a designer piece this unique! The denim is soft and comfy to the touch, and the perfect weight to get the drape needed for the drapey parts. The gorgeous stitching gives structure to the edges, and they hold their shape perfectly where needed. This is a good quality piece of clothing.\nYes, there is a duck tail when worn in side A - embrace it! (This is obvious on the model pics if you look at them). I suspect that It will probably soften a bit in time. TIP: Iron the seam between the collar and the body of the jacket and this will soften the bend.\nThe sleeves might be short on some people (again, look at the model pics & you will notice this) On me, the sleeves are wrist length on side B, a bit shorter on side A. Fine with me, I often roll sleeves up to intentionally make them 3/4 length. My shoulders are narrow; a wide-shouldered person would end up with an even shorter sleeve length.\nAlso, This is not JUST a two-way jacket! With all of the buttons and buttonholes you can really have fun experimenting with different ways to wear it - I keep playing with different ways to wear it.\nThe fabric does wrinkle easily, but that's definitely not enough to lose a star. Any wrinkling will lessen over time and washes.\nIt's fun that the Levi's label is on both ends of the jacket, but like others, I REALLY wish that Gary had credit on the label.\nThis jacket will get a LOT of wear from me! Team Gary all the way!!!",

				"I was looking for a lululemon align tank dupe and this is it! I’m honestly surprised this top hasn’t gotten more attention because it is such a gem!! I got an XS in black (32B) Please make more colors, especially in XS! I love activewear and I’m very impressed by the quality of this top for the price. The fabric is so soft stretchy and opaque yet sleek enough where it won’t pill. The fabric hugs me in and doesn’t gape at my waist (26”) so hopefully it won’t stretch over time. The seams themselves are different but they are positioned exactly the same as the align tank. I’m 5’6 and this top hits me right above my waist so I can comfortably wear high waisted leggings/pants without a ton of midriff being exposed. There is a lot of structure to the top which aids in providing medium support and functionality to the top even without adjustable straps. I’m hoping the straps won’t stretch out but the bra band inside is tight yet comfortable. Even the foam cups are nice! Because of the design, I’m not sure how this top would perform for bigger cup sizes as I do have a bit of side boob. Even on lulu’s site, the align tank is meant for smaller cup sizes. Nothing I can’t adjust but I can see this being an issue for larger chested girls. I am just so in love with the sweet heart neck line and sleek silhouette and I’m very pleased with this purchase😁 This is a great staple piece for anyone who’s ballin on a budget. Do not hesitate to buy this top!",

				" LOVE THESE TANKS!!!!! I read a bunch of reviews prior to purchasing and came across some mixed reviews regarding sizing. I originally ordered a large feeling like it could run on the small side and also from what other reviewers spoke on. The large fits fine but I ended up ordering other colors in a medium and that fits me much better. The material is very soft, stretchy and slightly looser in the stomach area. Comparing these tanks to lululemon align I would say these are a perfect dupe for the price. The align is definitely a thicker material, fit is tighter and the length is longer compared to these from amazon.\n\nFor reference I am a 34D and 150lbs and stand at 5’6.5. I attached a video and I wear high waisted everything so the tank looks longer than it really is so if you wear a lower rise you will show more midriff.",

The cons, it definitely looks a bit cheaper made than the align tank, the pads were dented, so it looked pretty bad with them (I just removed them and it works fine) and the edging of the tank near the chest looks a little off. I’m on the fence, but I think I’ll still keep it as I’ll get use out of it. For reference; I’m a 34D and size 6 in the align tank.",

				"All the positive reviews are true, this is a really great top! I will only buy premium workout leggings, but have been looking into more affordable tops and stumbled across this one. I really didn't expect to love it as much as I do. The fabric is soft and very thick, the cut is flattering, and it offers enough support for DD/DDD for casual wear and stretching/mobility sessions. As a matter of preference, I would never wear this for a serious training session unless I put a proper sports bra under, which would ruin the look. The product photos are very accurate - I found it to fit exactly as shown on the model. I am 128lbs, athletic, 32DD/DDD and purchased a size Small. The Small provides a cropped/fitted look and enough compression/support on top. Considering a Medium for times when I want a longer length, but concerned it won't provide as much support. This top will also look great with a pair of high waisted jeans as it doesn't look overly athletic, which I really appreciate. Highly recommend this product!",

The sleeves are not tight & I wear a sm & don’t have skinny arms. This cardigan is properly proportioned it has a nice flow & does not cling to the body. My only complaint is it arrived extremely wrinkled. I plan to steam w/ starch spray to keep it wrinkled free & to be able to wear more than once w/o wrinkles. Wrinkles drive me crazy & often iron many pieces of my clothing but I’m one of those people that do really mind ironing. Pls don’t not buy cuz mine was wrinkled as I’m sure it was from the shipping & weight of many other pkgs sitting on top. You’d cringe if u saw the way pkgs r handled.

				"I weigh 137 pounds, I'm 5'6\" and my chest is 38DD. I'm large chested, and my waist is almost the same as my hips. My butt is flat, and my legs are skinny. So I like to buy shirts that look taylored, but don't hug my waistline. I've purchased 3 of these shirts in different colors over the past 2 months because I like them so much. The cut and fit are flattering on my apple shape, and my husband likes the way i look in them (he thinks some of the other stuff I've ordered is \"frumpy\" LOL). I ordered a Medium size on the first shirt and it was too tight through the chest so I returned it for a larger size. The next two orders I made were XL and they were perfect. These shirts are not stretchy. They look like linen, but they're a cotton/poly blend. They washed up fine on gentle cycle and I dried them on low heat without shrinkage. If you remove them from the dryer immediately they'll have few to no wrinkles. I don't know about you, but I really appreciate other reviewers who are wiling to divulge their weight & measurements to help others with similar shapes make more accurate size choices. I hope this helps!",

				"I love this dress. I feel that it is a generous Medium in size. If you are the girl that cant decide on the medium or the large, then this maybe your dress. I usually have problems with fit in the chest 37DD (36 too tight 38 too big) I am sure ladies with similar size understand this. I was equally concerned because it has a zipper in the back and that usually is the kiss of death. This dress didn't let me down. I also think if you aren't as well endowed that it wont look big up top. The V-neck isn't too deep but enough to wear most any necklace. The sleeves are great with the bell and complete the look and the length is perfect. Not too long (I am 5.5) hits above the knee, but I can move freely without fear of exposing too much like some dresses. Im 49 and find that some I feel age inappropriate, however I am too young for other styles. I did order both the medium and the large for all of these reasons and the medium fit like a glove, so will return the large. Gotta love Prime and Kohls returns!",

				"This dress is adorable. It is fairly short. I’m 5 feet tall and it comes above my knee. I ordered up a size (got a medium) because I wanted something a little loose and flowy... should have gotten a large. I’m 5 feet tall 125 pounds and pretty curvy. It fits perfectly now but no extra room as I had wanted. I’ll have to decide whether to keep it or Exchange for large. I have to say it’s very cute, although sheer.\nUPDATE: I ordered a large to see if it would give me the boxier look I wanted. It does not, it just looks too big so I am returning it. Here’s the kicker though, it is lined! The last one I ordered is not lined, and if you’ll notice above I even said it was sheer! I thought about ordering a third time In medium in hopes of getting a lined one, but who knows what I’ll get next time. I’ve decided to just get a slip in black. Still an adorable dress for the price. Adding another update: just ordered my third one of these! Originally got black, then the royal blue and now just got the blush bamboo leaf print for a summer wedding. Love theses dresses. And further to the above review, this one is lined!",

The teal was an XL and the fuchsia was L. They both fit about the same! I guess the teal is slightly larger, but it's not enough difference to really be noticeable since the material is so stretchy and the front is drapes. The material is nice, very soft and comfortable. I removed one star because the hem is on the outside for some reason. It's designed that way, but it looks funny because it looks like an unfinished edge on the outside of your cardigan instead of sewed inside like it should be.\n\nSize reference: 5'4, 180lbs., 36DD.

As a musician, I’ve been looking for more flattering things to wear for gigs, and this is it! It’s substantial enough to CAMOS®️ (Cover A Multitude Of Sins), yet lightweight enough to not make me swelter under the hot stage lights.

I have to wear cardigans because my upper arms suck. :( I'm 5' 8\" tall, weigh 185. I also have a long torso, and large chested (38DDD/E). It didn't pucker under the arms at all, which is rare for me even with most XXL cardigans, and why I'e always stuck with black so it's not as noticable. Thought I ordered the black, but realized I ordered the green. So glad I did! This fit so well, I'm back to order two more colors, including white! They're very forgiving with the stretch in the arms. I did have to slightly adjust the arms so they were straight , but it didn't feel tight in the slighest. Once straightened, it laid flat and didn't bunch up. If you normally wear XXL, don't overlook this cardigan in the XL size. It's truly a nice garment!",

				"My daughter and I purchased 6 of these tops for our 5 week trip to India. We wore them constantly and washed them almost daily. After hand washing and wringing, we simply hung them on a hanger and they dried quickly and wrinkle-free. Even the ribbing around the neck kept it's shape! They also breathed well and were so comfortable to wear. We were originally going to pitch them after we got back but they are still in such great shape and so comfortable I think we will be wearing them for a long time.",

As you can see in the picture I probably could have sized down but because it is a somewhat stretch materia, I’m glad I didn’t. It is a bit long as well so you could pair it with leggings to cover the bum and a sweater.",

				"Love these basic T-shirt! I will be ordering more colors. The fabric is super soft and no scratchy tag. The V at the neck is the perfect length and the shirt overall has a great length. It has just the right fit so it’s not like wearing a boxy men’s undershirt but not so fitted to make me uncomfortable about my muffin top (fat hanging over top of my pants). The sleeves are nicely fitted giving the shirt class. I am 5’4” 140lbs and purchased Medium. I might have fit into a small but have broad shoulders (and thick waistline) and prefer a little room.",

				"Ordered the 2-pack of white in size Small based off reviews and that is the correct size. I'm 5'6\", 34B bra size, size 4-6 in shirts (usually a small), 28\" waist (usually 28 in premium denim and size 6 in pants), and somewhat pear shaped due to having narrower shoulders and wider hips.\nI would give this shirt 5 stars for quality of the material at this price point. I love a modal blend and this shirt is soft and smooth, but not tissue thin. You do need to wear a nude bra with the white, but the material has a nice heft to it.\nThe V neckline is moderate and there's no danger of cleavage or full coverage bras peeking above the neckline for me.\nI took off a star because this shirt is extremely long. You can see in one of the photos on the model that it's almost covering her behind. I would have to stretch the shirt to actually cover mine, but this definitely hits well below the start of the hip and I have an average length torso. I would say that this shirt fits like it was made as a tall. Ladies that are 5'4\" or shorter should be prepared for this to be tunic length.\nYou can sort of tell from the photos that this shirt is cut to taper in slightly at the waist and then flare out across the hips. I find this flattering and I would say it fits in the bust and waist as shown in photos. If you have slim/narrow hips, then this shirt won't fit right on you.\nI purchased these shirts to be able to tuck into pants and they are certainly easy to do that since they are so long, although the shirt does end quite a bit beneath my pants' waistline.\nNote: I could have sized down to an X-Small and still have the shirt fit in the shoulders, bust, and waist, but I'm confident it would be very tight around the hips. I'm ok with it being only slightly fitted (as shown on model) and staying with the Small. But if you're hoping for a more fitted look, then this shirt isn't for you.\nUPDATE September 25, 2018: I wore these shirts tucked into belted jeans and pants throughout the summer and came to really love them. Fit stayed the same after numerous washes (I was on cold and dry on low heat). The material did not pill, but it's not as smooth and perfect as when I first purchased, which is to be expected. I still think the shirt should be slightly shorter, but I've come to like how I can tuck these shirts into any rise of pants. I'll be purchasing more of these 2-packs in the spring for next summer.",

Will be returning for one size down.\n***Update*** Since the first one I purchased was way too big, I order the ombré gray. I ordered one size down, and now that one is too small! Unbelievable! I realized that the solid colored, and the ombré colored are two different material make ups. I prefer the solid make up which is polyester, rayon, and spandex. The ombré colored shirts are just poly/spandex, which makes it look a little shiny, and more clingy. Will be returning the second shirt.",

Looks like reviews not the same with prints as well.But the solids are great. Super soft cotton feel and great for summer. I'm super selfconscious of my arms and I like that these shirts have a flattering cut on the arms.

I have a large bust so a lot of v-neck shirts end up showing too much cleavage. This did not. It was great.

Tested seethru ability using nature valley granola bar unstretched and with orange plastic bottlecaps sitting on chest and not stretched out. Shirt has good amount of firm stretch, nice thickness of material but lightweigh feel. I got xl size for extra loose fit. It has nice wide sleeves that are ample enough for hiding your wings if you have wings. 95percent polyester, 5percent spandex blend. Made in china, but looks designed for american fit. No funny smell. This is a true xl loose fit, well made good buy. You can #freethenips with this shirt and not get a total staredown nor a long raised eyebrow. It is very vaguely seethru if you went specifically scrutinizing it. Definitely passable for darker skintones but might appear more seethru if you have lighter or if wearing non loose fit tighter size. Also depends on placement of the pattern how it falls on you. For ref i am 41/F chest, 37 waist 44hips and size xl is just right flowy loose fit on me. Good length, reaches below my butt. Im just short of fivetwo",

The sleeves are small but don't ride up into the armpits too bad. The material is thin, very soft & extremely comfortable. I really like the slits on the sides giving it a more feminine look. Very versatile & long enough to wear with a pair of leggings & cover up your bottom. True to size, I bought a small because I like a more “fitted” look.

				"giving this top 4 stars because it was a little small. i’m usually a large but i ordered an extra large cause i wanted it to be a little longer of a crop top but it hits and normal crop length (it might also have to do with the fact that i have a large 38DDD chest) but other than that i’m so pleased with me purchase. the material is thick and SO comfy. it feels like really nice t-shirt material. the arm length is perfect. the words are like ironed on but feel sturdy like they won’t fall off if i wash it. much better quality than expect especially for the price!! super cute, will definitely purchase more in the future. definitely recommend!! i’m also 5’4” 160lbs if that helps anyone lol",

It would take 2 of my wife to fit the small. According to the tag and feel of it, it is100% spandex unlike the description claimed. Not a hoodie like the listing claims also. Laid flat it measures 21 inches side to side. It is highlighter yellow not green. The only thing that actually matches the listing is the word double printed on. The bottom isn't straight and it has thread loose on a couple seams. Came crumpled up in a plastic bag. I will never order a product from this company again.",

				"I own a few of these - with hoodies and wanted one without. Found this one and had my fingers crossed since the last black one I purchased was super small and cheap material. I am very pleased with this one (black USA) in size medium. Material is soft, not thin or cheap but not too heavy so it can be worn summer nights. This one has a hem while the others I ordered had a raw hem. The sleeves are on the longer side but I prefer that. I haven’t washed it yet but if this one is anything like my white one I won’t have any issue - I hang to dry due to the USA decals that can fade or crack in the dryer. It is cropped but not super short - if u lift your arms a lot I suggest wearing a black bralette which looks cute underneath. I may order a grey one since I have red, white and black now and these are super cute !",

				"Do you love soft soft fabric? Do you want to feel cuddled and warm? This sweatshirt is my new boyfriend!\n\nI clicked on \"fits as expected\" in this review because the top fits like the pictures, and that is a generous fit. The length on me is almost a tunic and it works well with stretch jeggings. I have an apple shape but good legs from lots of walking, so like a lot of middle-aged women I've taken to wearing tight pants with a long top or tunic to cover the belly. This sweatshirt was a great buy!\n\nI got the blue color for a tone-on-tone look with jeggings or dark tights. You will want to experiment with a tonal undershirt or contrasting undershirt to peek through the big side vents. The side vents are placed toward the front rather than exactly at the side, so they will show off a T-shirt if you wear one underneath. That could be a neon color if you're feeling sporty, or a neutral if you want to just be comfy and blend in.\n\nI've machine washed and dried the shirt about a dozen times with no shrinking. The fabric feels like it might be starting to lose some softness or heft, but not bad so far. Love it. Highly recommended.",

				"I am 5'-6\", 138 pounds and I ordered a medium. I love the fabric. Nice fuzzy like inside, but not over bulky or too warm. The sleeves are a little tight on my forearms. It makes me concerned about what will happen if it gets thrown in the dryer by mistake. It says to air dry it flat, something I do with a lot of my tops, but being so much like a sweat shirt it could happen. Also, it is strangely made at the shoulders.The shoulder seems go from the neck band about an inch towards the back part of the neck and go out and down towards the back of my shoulder. I'm a seamstress so I love a new idea or way to sew something together, but I'm not sure this isn't going to make me nutty. It fits loosely, not baggy, so a size larger would not be as cute, I don't think.....",

				"I’ve now ordered a second one of these sweatshirts in olive. The sharkskin grey is lovely and I nearly just ordered a second one of them instead of trying any of the other colors. The fit is incredibly flattering and the side slit allows you to skip the hassle of “what do I do with the bottom of my sweatshirt?” No more constant french-tuck adjustments or a chilly abdomen from cropped sweatshirts. The slit doesn’t go so high as to show any skin, but allows the top to fall more easily at your sides. I’m 5’11” 115lbs and the size recommendation said to go with an xsmall...but I have broad shoulders and decided to go with the small. The fit is just right and I’d say this item doesn’t run quite as large as other similar styles by Daily Ritual. Looking forward to receiving the green one. Will report back if quality or fit differs from the gray. Love that the sharkskin gray is not heathered as I’m beginning to get quite tired of that trend. Washes well and is very comfortable.",

One could wear this as a blouse from casual to business, to a bathing suit cover up, and even as a nightshirt. I love love love it!

I usually wear an XL USA standard sizing and based on the reviews decided to get an XXXL and it was perfect. I wanted it to be a little loose fit and at 195 lbs 5'6 the XXXL was perfect. Room to stretch and move around in but not too baggy. Vibrant colors and true to the picture. Held up great during a wash and dry. As a guide to sizing if you want it to fit forming to your curves but not tight I would say go up 2 sizes. If you want it to have a loose boyfriend style fit like I did then go up 3 sizes. For a snug fit then just go up 1 size with caution that it may not fit depending on your bod shape.",

Oddly enough the back end actually covered my tush and then some. So one side is long, one side is considerably shorter.

The only issue is that it was too small so I had to return it. Plus, I have more of an hourglass figure, and the puffed sleeves really made my shoulders look large like a football player. So, this design is really for a tiny girl with no shoulders. Loved it though, and really wish it looked good on me.",

Not too night, not too lose, exactly how I had hoped it would fit and it seems like it should fit. I ordered the yellow and will say that the color is a bit more vibrant than what the photos make it seem. The photos to me make it look more like a pastel yellow when it’s really just more vibrant but also a great color of yellow for spring! It’s really soft too.

				"Very cute nice length covers back side shorter in front. Not see through but not a heavy material. I love the lighter cool material & 3/4 sl as I live in Florida where it can get quite humid. The sleeves are not tight & I wear a sm & don’t have skinny arms. This cardigan is properly proportioned it has a nice flow & does not cling to the body. My only complaint is it arrived extremely wrinkled. I plan to steam w/ starch spray to keep it wrinkled free & to be able to wear more than once w/o wrinkles. Wrinkles drive me crazy & often iron many pieces of my clothing but I’m one of those people that do really mind ironing. Pls don’t not buy cuz mine was wrinkled as I’m sure it was from the shipping & weight of many other pkgs sitting on top. You’d cringe if u saw the way pkgs r handled. I saw on Facebook I’m surprised anything I order arrived unbroken. I’m hoping once I wash & hang to dry it won’t be as wrinkled. U will be very happy w: this cadigan very pretty & slenderizing. 👍🏻💕",

				"Too small and the color is now right.\n\n1st, I bought the 3xl. It is too small, it fits like a 2lx and because I'm a busty girl the fabric at the front armholes is pulled out of shape. It's not at all flattering. I wear a 42DDD so, big, but not gigantic.\n\nThe color leans more true red than wine red. I'd actually call it deep red.\n\nAnd finally, the fabric is not as soft to the touch as i expected. It is flowy, but it oddly grabbed at any pieces of roughed up skin on my hands. Probably not something I'd normally notice but it is a factor when we all suffer from dry, rough, hand skin during this pandemic.",

				"While I do like this sweater, I felt I must point out a few things so that people would be aware of them. I am 5'3\", about 135# and I got the Large. It fits just right for me. I like my clothing loose-fitting, not form-fitting. It falls to the tops of my knees.\n*The snaps are cute, but they don't all work. I don't foresee myself wearing this with the snaps closed, so not a deal-killer for me. But this is the main reason I knocked off a star.\n*The ribbing on the bottom is pretty pronounced. If the snaps were closed, this would be very form-fitting.\n*I didn't realize that it, but it is recommended that this is Dry Clean Only. (The other reason for the 4 instead of 5 stars)\n*The color is great - I got the wine.\n*It's super comfy. The whole sweater has a ribbing feel to it. The actual ribbing areas are doubled material and wider ribs. Hope that makes sense, just trying to give a feel for the material.\n*The ribbing at the wrist is long. I like this feature because you can have it cuffed or not depending on whether you want it to go over your hands.\nConsidering all that, I hemmed and hawed about it, but decided to keep it.",

				"I love long sweaters and this sweater didn't disappoint. I was looking for something that was comfy and warm, but polished/fitted enough to wear in a casual office setting without appearing as if I was wearing a blanket or poncho. I ordered an XXL ( I am 5'10\" 40DDD, and a size 16-18) and it fits me well, the buttons close fully without and pulling or gaps and overall it is fitted without being tight. As depicted in the pictures, the sweater is fairly long and hits me about mid thigh. The weight/feel of it is closer to a thick t-shirt/jersey knit material than a classic sweater material, which I like, as I tend to run a bit warm. So far, I just wear it open over leggings or jeans and it is super cute, but I think it would also be cute over a casual dress as well. I ordered it in both green and red, the first one arrived with a small sewing defect in the left shoulder seam but I was able to close the gap with three or four stitches using a needle and thread. Other than that, it is a perfect sweater and I am considering ordering more.",

The material is a nice weight and feels good. The button detail/snaps are a burnished bronze and would most likely accessorize with gold. The color wine is brighter than the model photo but still a pretty color for fall. I probably will buy in another color. 😊",

				"Right after I received this shirt, I washed/rinsed it in cold water and hung it to dry. It came out very nice and I was in love with it the first time I wore it to work. I got lots of compliments on it too. I was ready to buy several more. I washed/dried it in the exact same manner and two weeks later (today) I put it on and I looked in the mirror and the right bottom seam was torn. And it's in a spot where I can't fix it without it being obvious, as I don't have a sewing machine and I'd have to use a needle and thread. I'm so disappointed. I truly loved this shirt too. It's nice and thick, but cool and breathable at the same time.\n\nUPDATE! Okay, so I sewed up the seam where it tore and it is STILL my favorite shirt ever. Hopefully nobody will notice! Had to update my review to reflect that. So, be mindful of how you handle this shirt. Yes, the seams could probably be sewn better, but it's MY fault for not being careful. I just had to buy another one in a different color. Sorry this is so long...\n\nOkay I got my second one, this one is navy and long sleeved. The long-sleeved and the short-sleeved are NOT made of the same fabric! The navy one is much more like a sweater type material so it's really for cooler weather. It's very nice and definitely not cheap feeling or cheap looking. It fits as nicely as my first one and I highly recommend them both!",

You may be able to see in the picture, that the sleeves and shoulders are a bit on the larger side (I hope winter layers will help somewhat). I did not subtract any stars for this.\n\nMany reviewers reported that this coat is warm enough for winter...for me, that remains to be seen.

				"Love this dress. Very flattering and true to size. Breezy and comfortable for a hot day. I wore heels for the picture and it looked amazing, but switched to sandals and it looked nice as well. I just had a baby and it worked perfect for nursing because of the tiny button on the chest.",

				" This dress is so cute and really comfortable. And flattering. The bottom portion it also looks sheer in the sunlight it's so gorgeous. It runs true to size and also has a snap along the bus so it doesn't go too low which I appreciate. I am 51 115 and this fits me as a small.",

				"This dress feels so nice to the touch! The material is really classy and elegant. I didn’t feel like it was a “me” dress but I wanted to keep the dress just cause of the material. I think it would look stunning on the right person. I’m 5’6” and 160 I got a medium it fit well. I also undid the snap",

				"This dress is actually really very nice. The material is nice and the sewing/construction is good too. I ordered three dresses two blue (in different sizes) and one orangey/brown. Both were pretty and I was hoping they would fit so I could add them to my meager dress collection.\nHowever - and I owe an apology to a previous reviewer who pretty much said 'don't buy this if you have a long torso - it's not the dress for you' bc she was absolutely right!!! I have a long torso (I'm 5'9\" and more than 1/2 my body is torso) so the dress fell more like an empire waist dress...which I could have overlooked but my body is 'full' so I just looked like a pregnant person or someone who drinks way to much and never exercises...and as someone who watches their diet and exercises I just couldn't do that to myself. I am sad bc the dresses are really cute and seem like they would fit the bill for almost any occasion. Now on the lookout for a similar dress with a different cut.\nIf you have a normal size torso or are slender (you don't need to be both) then this is the dress for you.\nFor reference I am 5'9\" 165lbs with an athletic build and the M fit perfectly...just awkwardly.",

				"Super cute dress, I couldn't upload a better picture. I felt comfortable in it and felt it was flattering to my body. I am 5'3 190 lbs. I think I got the XL maybe XXL I can't remember but it fit well all over except my boobs it was a bit tight on the chest area but nothing a nice bralet can't fix",

				"I am absolutely IN LOVE with this dress. Sometimes things can be hit or miss for me when ordering online, but this is exactly what I had hoped it would be. The material is nice and the fit is absolutely perfect, even for someone on the shorter side. I can’t say enough how excited I am to wear this dress to the office, and out and about on the weekend. Bring on the warmer weather! I ordered a size small.",
